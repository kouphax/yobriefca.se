  <p>I recently <a href="http://yobriefcase.posterous.com/validateinputattribute-changes-in-mvc3">blogged</a> about the new Exclude feature of ValidateInputAttribute in ASP.NET MVC 3 (Beta  2).&nbsp; Well as with most early adopter types I&rsquo;ve been shafted!&nbsp; Well not really  but things have changed slightly and it makes my last <a href="http://yobriefcase.posterous.com/validateinputattribute-changes-in-mvc3">post</a> slightly redundant.</p><p>Let me clarify a bit.&nbsp; The Exclude property no longer exists.&nbsp; It has instead  been replaced with a new attribute SkipRequestValidation.&nbsp; This is a  per-property attribute that lets you specify what properties should be  excluded.&nbsp; This has the effect of pushing the validation flag down to the model  rather than on the controller.&nbsp; This make a lot more sense especially in a  controller/solution that has many actions accepting the model.&nbsp; So what  changes?&nbsp; Lets take a look at our old code.</p><p>First things first the controller no longer need the ValidateInput attribute  and goes back to the old &ldquo;thinner&rdquo; version of itself,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/643503.js"></script></p><p>We then need to mark the Bodyt property of our ForumPost model to skip  validation,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/670517.js"></script></p><p>Thats it.&nbsp; To be honest this feels like a much neater solution.&nbsp; It feels  more a solution rather than a tacked on property that was added to cater for a  specific case.</p><p>ASP.NET MVC 3 RC1 is out now&nbsp;&ndash; read more <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/11/09/announcing-the-asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx">here</a>,  and get it <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191797">here</a>.</p>
