I missed the announcement last week the [Chutzpah 1.3 has been released](http://matthewmanela.com/blog/chutzpah-1-3-0-released/).  This is a big release as it brings support for [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine) - my BDD framework of choice for JavaScript.

<!-- more -->

[Chutzpah](http://chutzpah.codeplex.com/) is available as a plugin for Visual Studio but more importantly as a command line runner which allows us to integrate JavaScript testing into our continuious integration builds.  Excellent stuff!
