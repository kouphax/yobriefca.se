  <p>So MvcConf has been and gone.&nbsp; Lots of interesting talks though sadly I hit a  ton of technical issues with laggy video and eventually total audio/video loss.&nbsp;  To my ISP &ndash; shame on you!&nbsp; Luckily I did get to see most of the things I wanted  (or at least hear).&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the final outlay of talk I attended (green for  attended, yellow for not attended),</p><p class='img-holder'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3660/5720976997_50da11c786_o.png' style='width:100%;'></p><p>I kind&nbsp;of wanted to attend,</p><ul><li>Talks that I already had some experience in to see if my thoughts where  aligned with others, and, </li><li>Talks that I had not experience in but had an interest in. </li></ul><p>Problem was that in some of these talks I felt a bit out of my depth which  wasn&rsquo;t helped by the fact my video was busy drawing part of slides 4 and 5 when  the presenter was already on slide 7 :(.&nbsp; Other times I felt I had already dived  deeper than the talk was covering.&nbsp; I guess it happens!&nbsp; Anyway enough  complaining lets see what we covered,</p><h2>Real World Application Development with Mvc3 NHibernate, FluentNHibernate  and Castle Windsor</h2><p>Presenter: Chris Canal</p><p>I went into this talk wanting to get a quick glance at NHibernate  specifically.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had no exposure to any of these technologies (bar MVC3 of  course) and I think I suffered because of it.&nbsp; It was very Castle Windsor  focused and I think I would have been better jumping into a pure NHibernate talk  if there was one.&nbsp; That said I really should have a look at Castle Windsor.</p><h2>BDD in ASP.NET MVC using SpecFlow, WatiN and WatiN Test Helpers</h2><p>Presenter: Brandon Satrom</p><p>I recently attended a talk on using Cucumber to provide Automated UI testing  on our projects (held internally in our company) so I wanted to see what  SpecFlow brought to the table over running Ruby and Cucumber.&nbsp; I was very  impressed with what I seen.&nbsp; Nice explanation of the theory behind BDD.&nbsp; I like  the whole &ldquo;Working Software&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Working Software <strong>That Matters</strong>&rdquo;  comparison.</p><p>In terms of SpecFlow itself I like the tighter integration into .NET, the  ability to debug your steps is very nice and might help increase acceptance in a  team when compared to introducing Ruby.&nbsp; I can see the arguments for using  Ruby&nbsp;&ndash; Cucumber is a more mature, Ruby is faster to setup and tear down, using  the right tool for the right job etc. but I can also see the arguments against.&nbsp;  At least both farmeworks use the Gherkin language so writing the scenarios is  done in the same way.&nbsp; This is something I have to mull over a bit more.</p><h2>Quality Driven Web Acceptance Testing</h2><p>Presenter: Amir Barylko</p><p>I had a few audio and video problems during this presentation.&nbsp; It touched on  some theory behind Acceptance testing, Green Field vs Brown Field and things  like that then dropped into using Cucumber for some acceptance testing.&nbsp; Having  just attended the same type of talk a few days previous there wasn&rsquo;t anything  new here, and given the bad connection I skipped the rest of the talk.</p><h2>Keynote</h2><p>Presenter: Scott Guthrie</p><p>The Gu talking about stuff&nbsp;&ndash; nuff said.&nbsp; Nice to see him describing how cross  pollination of the three platforms (WebMatrix, WebForms, MVC) works (Razor from  WM, Routing from MVC etc.).&nbsp; Also nice to hear that we can expect an MVC release  on a near annual basis with plenty of preview releases inbetween!</p><h2>CQRS and Event Sourcing with MVC 3</h2><p>Presenter: Ashic Mahtab</p><p>Wow&nbsp;&ndash; CQRS is something I&rsquo;d heard of previously and it&rsquo;s a pretty big buzz  word in the Silverlight world at the minute so I wanted to check it out.&nbsp;  My&nbsp;head was thoroughly melted&nbsp;after this one.&nbsp; Quite fast paced and I could have  benefited from getting some prior reading in and around the CQRS concept.&nbsp; Will  revisit this once the video and slides are available.</p><p>One&nbsp;unexpected thing I got out of this talk was <a href="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications">MSpec</a>.&nbsp; I always  wondered how things like cucumber and spec flow handled lower level unit testing  and it seems they aren&rsquo;t really suited to that sort of thing.&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications">MSpec</a>, as I have  discovered, is essentially a unit level focused BDD framework.&nbsp; Going to check  this out very soon.</p><h2>Deploy ASP.NET MVC with No Effort</h2><p>Presenter: Troels Thomsen</p><p>Honorable mention here as my connection was flat out dying on this room.&nbsp; I  couldn;t make out video or audio very well.&nbsp; I did spend a few hours a few days  ago looking at <a href="https://appharbor.com/">appharbor</a> and it looks like,  as the name says, &ldquo;Azure done right&rdquo;.&nbsp; Love the use of git as a deployment  framework, love the minimal interface, love the pricing model, just love the  whole thing&nbsp;&ndash; so I&rsquo;m sorry I had to miss the presentation.&nbsp; Another one to check  out later.</p><h2>Entity Framework "Code First": Domain Driven CRUD</h2><p>Presenter: Chris Zavaleta</p><p>Having been playing with EF CTP5 recently I wanted this one to see if there  was anything worth expanding on.&nbsp; Turns out there is some nice stuff I didn&rsquo;t  see during my tinkering.&nbsp; Especially around the use of Configuration Categories  to break apart the OnModelCreating configuration and the Seeding stuff to  populate the DB with data.&nbsp; Again my audio was dropping off constantly and my  video was struggling so I had to drop out early on this one and throw in the  towel.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>All in all a decent conference I could have done with reading up on some of  the subjects before hand.&nbsp; I will be visiting many of talks again when they come  online to get a better picture (pun intended) of the topics.&nbsp; Big thanks to all  involved.</p>
