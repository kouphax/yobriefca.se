  <p>jQuery Mobile was <span style="color: #1f497d;"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/2010/10/jquery-mobile-alpha-1-released/">released</a></span> over the weekend or at least the alpha version of it was (full release scheduled for some time on 2011).&nbsp;</p><p>So what is it like?&nbsp; Well first things first it's early days, there are certainly more than few rough edges but given the development timeline (~2 months) it is quite an impressive effort put in by the <span style="color: #1f497d;"><a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/">Filament Group</a></span> and others.</p><h2>iThings</h2><p>The first question most people will ask (or the first thing they will try and do) will probably be</p><blockquote><p style="padding-left: 30px;">So how does it look on the various iThings (iPad, iPhone, iPhone 4)?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Well it looks good for the most part.&nbsp; There are some issues around page transitions and displaying dialogs (especially on the iPad) - things like page flickering, hidden content becoming visible after the page has loaded etc. and while they are a bit annoying they don't "break" anything.</p><p>As the framework isn't targeting iOS specifically there are some behaviours that would wouldn't necessarily expect if you used this as a native app (using PhoneGap or whatever).&nbsp; Toolbars aren't explicitly fixed and when they are fixed disappear on scroll and repositioned after scrolling has finished.&nbsp; Select boxes don't display the normal pickers found in native iOS but instead use a custom dialog for selection.&nbsp; Again these aren't criticisms, they work well, but I have heard people already complaining because they expect the framework to produce a fully native looking app.</p><h2>Sencha Touch</h2><p>When comparing frameworks many peoples first thoughts will be</p><blockquote><p style="padding-left: 30px;">How does it compare to <span style="color: #1f497d;"><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>To be honest&nbsp; the comparison is like comparing apples to oranges, or jQueryUI to ExtJS.&nbsp; Both projects have also different goals.&nbsp; While Sencha currently aims to provide a rich native like experience on a small subset of mobile browsers (specifically iOS and Android), jQuery Mobile aims to create a consistent, mobile/touch capable experience across a much <span style="color: #1f497d;"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/Touch">wider range of mobile browsers</a></span>.&nbsp; This is by no means easy.&nbsp; An interaction style one device may not be suitable for another.</p><h2>FOUC</h2><p>One of the goals of jQuery Mobile is to progressively enhance the base page to become more mobile capable.&nbsp; Because of this the base page is very basic with jQuery Mobile specific stylers applied when the DOM is ready.&nbsp; This can lead to some initial FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content).&nbsp; We can get around this by applying some of the basic jQuery Mobile styles to begin with and I suspect we will see this tactic being used on future releases.</p><p>[[posterous-content:EeHJJwvCqFJrzcdxeEEb]]</p><h2>Accessibility</h2><p>One thing I never really though of in a Mobile Framework is accessibility.&nbsp; This is just short sightedness on my part as it is as relevant in the mobile world as it is in the desktop world.&nbsp; jQuery Mobile aiming to be fully accessible through it's use of ARIA roles and progressive enhancement.</p><h2>The Technicals</h2><p>From a technical/developer stand point jQuery Mobile is quite nice.&nbsp; Lets look at a few of the highlights,</p><h3>Pages</h3><p>Sites can be built as a single page with sub sections being marked as "pages" that jQuery Mobile can navigate.&nbsp; External pages are load using ajax (rather than simply navigating to them), this give jQuery Mobile better control over transitions, and history management.&nbsp; A simple page looks like this,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/631896.js"></script></p><p>So lets break this down and pick out the interesting parts,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/631897.js"></script></p><p>HTML5 DocType which older browsers can handle gracefully</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/631899.js"></script></p><p>Scripts and styles included.&nbsp; Now from a mobile perspective this is still quite a bit of script especially over some flaky 3G connections but in comparison to some of the frameworks out there it is still quite small.</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/631900.js"></script></p><p>This section describes 2 pages.&nbsp; A page is marked as a page by its `data-role` attribute and can contain 3 elements marking a header, the page content and the footer.&nbsp; Unless stipulated the first page will be first page in the DOM.&nbsp; Navigation between pages is handled using location.hash changes (page 1s button links to Page 2 in the example).</p><h3>Themeing</h3><p>Themeroller will see an overhaul on the official release which will allow you to create custom themes a la jQueryUI.&nbsp; Currently jQuery Mobile comes with 2 themes both of which have a number of swtaches.&nbsp; This is intended to create contrast between UI elements (e.g. for marking mandatory fields, or highlight primary buttons on a form etc.)</p><h3>Dialogs</h3><p>Dialogs in jQuery Mobile are simply pages with a `data-rel="dialog"` added to them so the same rules apply as above.</p><h3>Form Elements</h3><p>Forms in jQuery Mobile are plain old HTML(5) forms which is actually a VERY nice feature.&nbsp; Sencha/ExtJS forms are nice but when using SELECTs etc. can become a real pain to manage.&nbsp; jQuery Mobile uses a much lighter approach.&nbsp; Some screenshots (iPhone 4)</p><p>[[posterous-content:qipBwFyayBhuztrHFpJI]] So thats a very quick overview of jQuery Mobile.  I encourage you to play around with and get those bugs filed. &nbsp;As I've said it's early days but it's a big goal they are aiming for and they are currently well on track to produce a very nice framework come the official release.</p>
