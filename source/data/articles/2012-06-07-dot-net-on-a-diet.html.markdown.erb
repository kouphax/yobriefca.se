## Description

There are plenty of framework options in .NET. We have the big mainstream web frameworks like ASP.NET WebForms and MVC, the ORM abstractions and DataMappers in the form of Entity Framework, NHibernate and iBatis and services such as WCF requiring large amounts of careful configuration to get right. Unfortunately these frameworks can get in the way, abstractions breakdown and leak and eventually we end up fighting against the frameworks limitations.

This session will take a look at the feature-fit lightweight alternatives and how they can be used to compose a technology stack that is cruft-free and fit for purpose.
