... in with the new.  So I've started rolling out my new site, expect somethings to be slightly broken as images and whatnot have been moved around.  Spent a day or two designing a new site that was similar to the old one but slightly better.  Eventually got frustrated at my inability to do any sort of graphical design and went the [Octopress](http://octopress.org).

Still a few things to tweak, possibly add a splash of colour around the place and give it a bit more life.  Also apologies to people who subscribe to my feed - looks like the new feed has pushed all the old posts out as new.  But hey they are worth reading twice!
