  <p><span class="caps">SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENCASTS</span> <span class="caps">GALORE</span>!</p><p>So I unveiled the new <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> section of the site.  Can you guess whats in it?  Those who said &#8220;screencasts&#8221; you can have a nice non-patronising pat on the head.  The rest of you&#8230;. for shame.
