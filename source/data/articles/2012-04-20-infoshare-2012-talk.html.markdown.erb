## Comments

So how did it go?  From my perspective it could have been better - I'm not sure why started "ummmmming" all the time - I had plenty to say (and I think I talked too fast as well).  I just started in a semi-flustered state for reasons unknown.  I seen a few decent comments on twitter so I guess it was fairly well received thats what matters.  If anyone has any other observations, no matter how harsh, let me know.

One more note - Gdasnk is awesome - the technical people are so engaged and enthusiastic, the place itself is really interesting and I managed try my new favourite shot - [Mad Dog](http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink10324.html).  Thanks for the opportunity Gdasnk and Infoshare.  Hopefully I can back here and spend more time in the city soon.
