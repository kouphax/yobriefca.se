So I'm no longer a conference speaker virgin.  It was so good I did it twice in the same day.  How'd it go?  Went good I guess.  From a conference stand point it seemed to fly by.  There was a kind of laid back atmosphere about the whole thing and the numbers, while lower than expected were high enough to make all the talks feel comfortably occupied.  I skipped the first block to get my talk prepared but managed to pull in a few talks after I got my first one over.

# Other Peoples Talks

## Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) with F# - Phillip Trelford

Big toss up here as I wanted to attend [Andrea's Code Kata](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=871) as well but this talk won out.  It was a decent talk - a nice mix of theory and practise.  Interesting to see Phils testing framework, [TickSpec](http://tickspec.codeplex.com), in action, I must revisit this again some time soon (a promise I'll probably never keep :( ).

## CQRS - Bringing Elegance to "Normal" Applications - Ashic Mahtab

The last CQRS talk I attended flew right over my head in terms of complexity.  Since then I've done a bit of research and came prepared.  I really didn't need to though.  Ashic did a really good job of taking something that appears quite complex and conveying the message quite nicely.  Interested to see his 250 LOC CQRS framework as well!

# My Talks

## refORM: Death to ORMs in .NET

Went quite well.  I played it safe in terms of not going for any live coding but I think it would have been much better if I had (and plan to next time week at DDDNorth) as it was more dry than I would have liked.  Lots of good discussion after the presentation that I might try and bring in next time too.

## Coffeescript the Awesome

Slight technical problem resulted in the majority of the code samples being nearly unreadable for a lot of the presentation which was a total fail.  I think I flew through the whole thing too - perhaps a bit of live coding would have improved this one too.  That said the discussion lasted as long as the talk more or less which is good.  Another problem was a number of people came in quite late and missed the first lot of slides which meant I was repeating the content at the end but hey thats fine.
