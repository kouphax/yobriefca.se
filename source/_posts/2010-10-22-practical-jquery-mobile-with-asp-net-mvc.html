  <p>That's a bit of a mouthful.&nbsp; I wanted to write a post about creating a basic  jQuery Mobile app but as I started putting the code together MVC became more and  more involved so I combined the 2.</p><p>The end solution?&nbsp; Lets create a phone directory with 2 main views,</p><ol><li>A filterable list of all people with quick info (telephone extension and  name) that is grouped and sorted alphabetically, and,</li><li>A disclosure view of a selected person showing more details including a  photo</li></ol><p>[[posterous-content:FddxCHuIgArIuezHEbcn]]</p><h2>MVC (The Server Side)</h2><p>jQuery Mobile works by progressive enhancement and uses Ajax to load and  parse external links so it has more control over page transitions and Ajax  history.&nbsp; This means that we create a plain old website that will work without  jQuery Mobile, Ajax or any JavaScript.&nbsp; So I started with the ASP.NET MVC 2 Web  Application Visual Studio Template and ripped out everything bar the Home  Controller and the 2 views.&nbsp; I also stripped the Site.Master down to the bare  bones.</p><p>Next I created my model with data access methods,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640270.js"></script></p><p>You can implement your own data access there or just hard code some values.&nbsp;  Next I updated the HomeController to return the right models&nbsp; to the views</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640281.js"></script></p><p>I updated the views to&nbsp;display the information in a straightforward way.&nbsp;</p><p>Index.aspx</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640303.js"></script></p><p>About.aspx</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640304.js"></script></p><p>This leaves us with a normal, not so pretty but fully functioning site.&nbsp;</p><p>[[posterous-content:DblJukiumuFlvvqlHokq]]</p><p>Now lets inject some mobile niceness into it,</p><h2>jQuery Mobile</h2><p>First things first lets put reference to jQuery and jQuery Mobile&nbsp; (script  and css) into our site master and update our DOCTYPE to the HTML5 DOCTYPE  leaving us with,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640308.js"></script></p><p>Now we need to tell jQuery Mobile how to layout the pages and mobilise.&nbsp; This  isn&rsquo;t necessarily done in script as you might think.&nbsp; jQuery Mobile makes use of  HTML5&rsquo;s data- attributes to identify how the page should be laid out and mark  areas to specific roles.</p><p>Index.aspx</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640312.js"></script></p><p>About.aspx</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/640313.js"></script></p><p>So what have we added here?&nbsp;</p><ul><li>data-roles&nbsp;&ndash; telling jQuery Mobile what each div actually represents e.g.     <ul><li>page&nbsp;&ndash; a single view (a single html page can have multiple views)</li><li>header&nbsp;&ndash; the header of a page</li><li>content&nbsp;&ndash; the pages content</li><li>footer&nbsp;&ndash; the footer of a page</li><li>list-view&nbsp;&ndash; a special&nbsp;role to&nbsp;specifying &nbsp;that the content is a list</li><li>list-divider&nbsp;&ndash; a divide for a list that doesn&rsquo;t do anything but look  different</li></ul></li><li>data-filter&nbsp;&ndash; telling jQuery Mobile that&nbsp;it should provide filtering on this  view</li><li>ui-li-aside class identifies that this is some aside information for this  list item</li></ul><p>And that is it.&nbsp; We have taken a static site and without writing any code  (bar markup) created a mobile app.&nbsp; Probably might be a good idea to include an  application cache manifest file as well so there is some semblance of offline  capability provided.&nbsp; But that's for another day.</p><p>[[posterous-content:pJHwwsHHmrfAkJIJFkrp]]</p>
