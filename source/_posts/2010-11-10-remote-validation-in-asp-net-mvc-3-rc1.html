  <p><em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: &nbsp;Added some words around the extra configuration options available</em></p><p>Remote validation has finally landed in RC1 of <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/11/09/announcing-the-asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx">ASP.NET  MVC 3</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;weird area as more often than not people tend to over  complicate something that is really pretty simple.&nbsp; Thankfully the MVC  implementation is fairly straightforward by simply providing wiring allowing the <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/">jQuery  Validation</a> plugin to work it's magic.&nbsp; Basically there is a new Remote attribute that can be used  like so.</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/670685.js"></script></p><p>As you can see we have attributed the Username field with a Remote  attribute.&nbsp; The 2 parameters tell us what Action and Controller we should call  to perform the validation. &nbsp;This does make me feel slightly uneasy as it kind of feels like you are coupling the controller to the model which doesn't sit right by me. &nbsp;currently sitting on the fence I'll see how it works in real life. &nbsp;Anyway I implemented it like so,</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/670712.js"></script></p><p>And thats you - provided you have the necessary client side libraries included  of course (jQuery, jQuery Validate etc). and have Client Side Validation turned on (now by default in MVC3).</p><h2>Configuration</h2><p>The Remote attribute offers a few nice little configuration options to make  things easier.&nbsp; The typical ones are there such as ErrorMessage, ErrorResource  etc. but there are a few specific ones as well.</p><h3>Fields</h3><p>There may be a case where ding the name and the value of a single form field  isn&rsquo;t enough to perform validation.&nbsp; Perhaps validation is affected by some  other field/value in the form.&nbsp; The Remote attribute accepts a comma separated  list of other fields that need to be sent up with the request using the Fields  parameter</p><p>This basic example will send up the value of the EmailService input field  along with the value of Username.&nbsp; Clean and simple.</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/672168.js"></script></p><h3>HttpMethod</h3><p>HttpMethod simply allows us to change how the ajax request is sent e.g. via  POST or GET or anything else that makes sense.&nbsp; So to send a remote request via  POST</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/672169.js"></script></p><h2>A Minor Difference</h2><p>You might notice if you read the release notes for RC1 that my implementation  of the controller is slightly different.&nbsp; The reason being that the example in  the release notes is broken :-).&nbsp; The example looks like this</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/670723.js"></script></p><p>However the Validate plugin expects a JSON response which is fine on the  surface but returning a boolean response to the client side results in a  response body of False (notice the captial F) which in turn causes a parse error  when the plugin performs JSON.parse.&nbsp; My suggested solution is actually more  inline with how most people would typically write an Ajax capable controller  action anyway (though I am not happy with the JsonRequestBehaviour usage) but  there are other ways but they aren&rsquo;t pretty&hellip;.</p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/670736.js"></script></p><p>See?&nbsp; Ugly and plain <strong>WRONG</strong> (but it will work).</p><p>Nice to see this feature finally landing as it can be useful in certain  situations.</p>
