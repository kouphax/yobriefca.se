> My dad passed away on the 18th of January 2017.  Today we said godbye. I wrote this for him.

Pour one out for the big lad.

Pour one out for the man who had only one hobby… to collect hobbies.

Pour one out for the stamp collector, the rally driver, the mountaineer, the orienteer, the cyclist, the swimmer, the runner, the climber, the small plane aviator and the musician.

Pour one out for the computer tinkerer, the builder, the carpenter, the engineer, the mechanic, the brewer, the distiller, the vintner, the gamer, the cocktail maker, the model maker, the baker and painter.

Pour one out for the bird watcher, the butterfly catcher, the moth genitalia dissecting discovery maker, the toast maker, the camper, the caravaner, the biker, the hiker, the fisher, the poacher, the gardener, the bonsai grower, the shutter fitter, the marketing director, the sales man, the gambler, the trivia master and the teacher.

Pour one out for the man who taught me to drink, taught me to run, taught me how to use a computer, to ride a bike, to climb, to hike, to navigate, to camp, to fish, to tie knots, to wire a plug, to drill holes and millions of other things I've already forgotten.

Pour one out for the man who… tried… to teach me to drive.

Pour one out for the man who taught me to be pragmatic, to think critically and to respect nature.

Pour one out for my best man my wedding.

Pour one out for the man who liked his whisky smokey and his gin and tonic by the pint glass.

Pour one out for the grumpy one, the one who couldn't hold his drink, the one who just had to argue, the one who was always right.

Pour one out for the man who could happily sit in silence but who, if necessary, could fill any silence with a story.

Pour one out for the man with ALL the stories.  The great stories, the simple stories, the funny stories, the stories you've probably heard already a dozen times but would happily hear again.

Pour one out for the man who taught me rules are for other people…. unless of course they were his rules.

Pour one out for the man who spent his summers driving us through Ireland, England, France, Spain, Germany, Italy hours on the road to show us fantastic things.

Pour one out for the man that knew someone no matter where he was or what he was doing.  

Pour one out for the big lad and let’s drink to the man we've lost.
