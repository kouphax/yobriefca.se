I run because it helps me clear my head

I run because it gives me time to think about things

I run because the place I live can be rather pretty

I run because I need to lose weight

I run because I want to get healthier

I don't run because I want to get faster

I don't run to get sub 40 min 10k times

I don't run because I want to compete

I stop running when it becomes a chore

I stop running when it becomes a competition

I stop runnning when it stops being fun
