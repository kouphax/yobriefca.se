# Now

I've been travelling a lot for work (3 days a week at least) which splits my week and therefore life directly down the middle and I've been finding it pretty hard to devote time to side projects despite all the ideas I have.  On the plus side it means when I'm home I'm rarely distracted by work and can pour my time into my family and hobbies.

## Work

Daily grind includes working with Deloitte to deliver public facing services for the Home Office using Scala, Mongo and Ansible. This means I'm constantly struggling with my love/hate relationship with Scala and the JVM.

Sporadically working on a fairly simple side project using Go (previously Clojure, PHP and Scala) and an undecided data store. Very sporadically.

While I haven't written or delivered talks in a while (mainly due to travel) I'm building up a backlog of unpublished articles, ideas for articles and talks around data modelling, data processing and culture.

## Play

I'm trying [run as often as possible](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1619296).  Aiming for a slowish pace run for an hour (typically about 10k) or so every day I'm in Belfast and about an 8k's worth of walking in London.  I'm also trying to rekindle my old love of climbing.

Musically there has been some decent music this year (including discoveries from previous years) like [Blink 182](https://open.spotify.com/album/4wuYQ9hyF1EGmrtjMpgpE9), [Biffy Clyro](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gSoMEnVL0sZlROP2bDVqd), [Frightened Rabbit](https://open.spotify.com/album/1X5F9Oyo1iiL2iebxwtwI1), [The Falcon](https://open.spotify.com/album/3oPCvITI0easUtGTbLwarn), [Animal Flag](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2McsStc6upTOqNbZjqFQEi), [Wolf Alice](https://open.spotify.com/album/0k5PHXVakV1aq3UmacxELa), [All Get Out](https://open.spotify.com/album/77QwAgipGzLQg3f5LG9ayI).

I've started filling my travel and running times with podcasts.  [The Message](http://themessagepodcast.com/) was pretty great, as was [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast) but my mainstays these days are [Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People](http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/) and [My Dad Wrote a Porno](https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/my_dad_wrote_a_porno/).

I'm not reading as much this year as I did last year but I just finished [All the Birds in the Sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25372801-all-the-birds-in-the-sky?ac=1&from_search=true) which I can only describe as a brilliant book, terribly written.  I'm also trying to digest more comics such as [Lumberjanes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21876672-lumberjanes-1?ac=1&from_search=true), [Rat Queens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20299683-rat-queens-vol-1?ac=1&from_search=true) and [Sandman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23754.The_Sandman_Vol_1?ac=1&from_search=true).

I'm still filling empty shelves with board games and recent favourites include - [Exploding Kittens](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172225/exploding-kittens), [Istanbul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148949/istanbul), [Odin's Ravens](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192074/odins-ravens-second-edition) and [Escape: Curse of the Temple](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113294/escape-curse-temple).
