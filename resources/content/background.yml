abstract:
  A software engineer with a strong passion for
  crafting high quality solutions, using the right tools, technologies,
  techniques and, most importantly, people.


  A firm believer in knowledge sharing and this is evident in my 
  speaking engagements, education authoring and online writing. I also
  strongly believe the generalist approach to software development is
  essential to truly understanding both the "how" and the "why" of technologies,
  patterns and approaches so that projects are delivered with a focus on user
  needs rather than developer or team bias.
