I run because it's a nice middle ground between cycling and walking. Cycling is an activity I just don't enjoy and also I am historically accident prone while doing it while walking is an activity I love but is a massive time sink to do it properly.

I run because there are nice forest paths and countryside near where I live so I get to get outside.

I run because it's a great opportunity to really just think things through.

I run, more now than previous years, because I read [The End of the World Running Club](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617452-the-end-of-the-world-running-club) at the middle of last year and for some reason it stuck with me.

I don't run to get better times or longer distances.  I don't run to compete in any meaningful way. Every time I intentionally try to improve (on a per run basis - I quite like seeing yearly distances improve) it seems to suck the fun out of it and I get demotivated.  Right now I like to run for about an hour or so each time, occasionally I just keep running for up to 2 hours but I don't really force myself, if it feels right I keep going.

I find the hardest runs are the ones when I have nothing to think about or nothing compelling to listen to (podcasts or music wise).  I find the easiest runs are the ones when I'm working on a problem and time just flies.

I rarely let myself feel out of breath or exhausted because when that happens I just keep moving but slow the pace.  I just plod along at decent enough pace (for me), cover a distance I'm happy with and that's that.

Here's a wee heat map of the places I ran last year.  Might be nice to diversify a tiny bit this year?

## South Belfast

## North Belfast

## London

And here is some meaningless stats for you to ignore,

```
Distance:   1,015.5 km
Time:       104h 9m
Elev Gain:  9,422 m
Runs:       123
```

Thinking I could probably boost that distance figure if I maintain the same attitude I had since the middle of last year.
