> Warning this is going to be messy. This is going to be very personal (hence why it is on my unlisted section), very scrappy and all over the place. I may not publicise this but right now I think I want to, I think it will help me mentally but also, I can't find a reason to validate this assumption and I honestly hope this doesn't come across as just some guy being "woe is me" or something. If you're not cool I'm still cool with you. 

> Oh and there is probably going to be one or two sweary words in here.

Things I know,

- I'm not suicidal
- I'm not yet at rock bottom but I soon will be.
- I drink too much
- I'm truly and utterly mentally exhausted
- I've got a lot of work to do

## I'm not suicidal

Before we begin despite how hopeless this writing may turn out to be (or maybe it wont, we'll see) I know this is not the end. There have been times when I've been at a particularly low point that I've not wanted to exist but thats not the same as wanting to kill yourself. Nonexistence is, to me, almost the opposite. If I never mattered to anyone, if I never had physical or mental form. Yeah, I've felt that would be pretty neat but I'm alive now so that is not an option and besides I've got things to live for. But anyway, I wanted to caveat whatever this turns out to be.

## I'm not yet at rock bottom but I soon will be.

So yeah. Let's recap. Towards the end of last year my wife left me. After a year of being truly and utterly non-communicative I somewhat forced her hand to come to a decision because of my father's failing health. He had gone downhill quite quickly and I didn't want one of two things to happen,

1. I didn't want her to stick around because of my father dying,
2. I didn't want her to decide this wasn't for her in and around my father passing

Sadly everything came to a head just months before my father passed. Yeah sure I knew he was dying but Christ it was pretty sudden none the less.

So anyway, lots of shit has went down. Oddly at the end of Christmas I made a prediction that I'll start feeling better about the dissolution of my marriage around the start of February. My rationale was that it would be enough "firsts" to really harden the spirit and cause closure. The firsts were,

1. First Christmas "alone"
2. First New Years "alone"
3. First Kids birthday "alone"
4. And finally, first Birthday "alone"

I want to talk about what alone means in this context soon by the way. It seemed like a plan. Christmas was hard as hell. New Year's 2016/2017 was the first time I spent New Year's out and about in well over a decade and I got to about 11:30/11:45 before I really just wanted to go home and go to bed. I didn't, I danced instead, just to keep moving, just to blank it all out. Next up was first kid's birthday but then this was the time my dad died and, well, the theory never got a good run after that.

But closure is coming now I think. I don't want to talk too much about specifics but my ex-wife is going on a date on Saturday and hooooly fuckbatons this is weird. Even thinking about the concept makes me panicky and a bit ill. The closer to the "big day" it gets the worse those feelings are and my dickhead of a brain refuses to let me think about other things. Ugh even writing this down makes me want to scream into a pillow.... again (it is quite cathartic, I thought it might have been a movie thing). I mean it's her life and for all intents and purposes I think her marriage was over nearly year before mine was in many way but it just seems so soon (I mean I guess it's not really if I'm honest but that's how it feels). But either way it freaks me out and if I'm being really brutal a bit jealous and a bit pissed that I didn't get there first. But, yikes, that might have been one hell of a toxic relationship if I did get there first. I mean look at me right now! What the hell am I talking about?

Oh, as an aside I wanted to use fancy words to talk about something I've been thinking about. The specificity of loneliness. Ready? We'll get back to the main event shortly,

If CSS taught me one thing it was the phrase "specificity". Specificity - the quality or condition of being specific. And that's how I feel about loneliness right now. I have friends, family and kids that I enjoy spending time with as much as I can I'm surrounded by people but since my wife declared she no longer loved me I feel completely alone in this sea of people and I feel guilt for not feeling fulfilled by all the other people around me. But the more and more I think about it they provide the kind of support that isn't exactly the same as, say, a wife you've become somewhat emotionally dependent on so it leaves a hole. You hear people going "buck up kiddo you've got all these loving people around you" and "you should be happy" but you now what? No. There is a "hole", an emptiness so to speak that is left and everyone else is the wrong shape to fill that hole. So, when people say "you should be happy" or whatever don't let them. You have a right to feel lonely. Don't wallow in it of course, it can be filled by things in time, it has to, just allow yourself to not feel bad for feeling lonely despite the emotional support around you.

Anyway that wee rant is over. Here another quick one, somewhat, about Tinder.

Let me make a statement - I got exceptionally lucky with finding my wife. My social skills are truly fucking awful and before her I had a very small handful of very short relationships. In every case those relationships arose out of situations that at 37 never happen anymore and truth be told my social skills have only gotten worse. I've become so specialised in my social interactions that "casual" interactions are not even on my life's resume anymore. So that brings me to Tinder. I joined Tinder and believe me I really tried to use it but fucking hell that shit is just fucking icky. Like ewwwwww that is 100% certainly *not* for me.

Anyway where was I? Ah yes, rock bottom. I think Saturday night, the night my wife goes out on her date in case you've gotten lost in my meandering word train, is going to be weird, tough and I kind of need to somehow skip it. Which brings me nicely along to the next thing I know.

## I drink too much

I do. I use alcohol to mask my weird social inabilities. From 1st January 2017 there are certainly more days were I've had a drink than haven't. Here are some reasons why I drink (aka excuses),

1. Wife leaving me
2. Wife going on a date
3. Bad day at work (there are a lot of these recently)
4. Dad dying
5. Being in London with friends (as I travel for work).

All those things are all happening/have happened recently. Life comes at you fast. I need to cut down.  Well in fact I might need to stop. Woah that makes me a bit anxious though. Like I'm so socially terrible that would kind of turn me into a recluse and that's not going to help things. I'd end up just writing more things like this. I need better control, I need to stop using it as a crutch. If I'm also honest it also sure as shit makes things worse. It makes me feel like crap, I feel fat and really hating on my body, hangovers in work are the worst and I'm just not running/exercising as much as I'd like (which in turn, what with the reduction of exercise, also makes me feel bad). 

As a side note on exercise: I've tried various antidepressant drugs and doses over the years for whatever I have and they just don't seem to be "for me". Exercise always seemed to help. The natural output - endorphins etc. - from exercise combined with the positive changes in a physical form that often makes me look in the mirror in disgust seem to have a positive effect on my emotional state. 
But with the return to heavy drinking all the good work I've put since the middle of last year (large amounts of running etc.) are being pissed up the wall because I'm making up a massive number of calories in drink alone every week.

I mean there is an easy fix for this or at least on the surface it seems like an easy fix but wait up there is another reason why I currently use drinking as a bit of a crutch.... and so, begins the final statement in this pityramble.

## I'm truly and utterly mentally exhausted

Yep. Being mentally or emotionally exhausted has the following effects on me.

1. It makes going out for runs or doing exercise harder
2. It makes running hard because it makes time pass unbelievably slow
3. It convinces me I'm physically tired even when all indicators suggest I'm not so even when I do force my bloated husk out into the forest my pace is *terrible* and my head is screaming at me to give up at the 30-minute mark and to even get to that point feels like an eternity.
4. It makes me utterly incapable to focusing in work or solving big hard problems, or focus or just generally care about what I'm doing which makes my work sloppy and makes me shit at articulating problems in meetings.
5. It makes me frustrated at the smallest things which makes me perceive everything as very negative and doom and gloom until I can somehow make it a self-fulfilling prophecy
6. It makes me a very negative person
7. It makes me shit company. Top that with my terrible emotional/social skills and you've got yourself, well basically - something pretty grim.
8. I derive little to pleasure from pretty much *anything*.
9. I read less
10. I play less board games (which is supposed to be a hobby of mine)
11. It makes it very hard to think of fun things to do with my kids which in turn makes me feel like a shitty father which makes everything worse.
12. I drink more because it's easier.
13. I either don't eat for days due to being full of nervous energy or gorge on crap when I'm feel super low.
14. The thought of spending time with my wife (we are friendly and live in the same house still) gives me anxiety but also, I want to if that even makes sense. Like I don't hold any ill will against her but also I mean it does often feel that she kind of fucked me over too.  This kind of looping logic blows my stack (ha a computer analogy!)
15. I either can't sleep or want to sleep too much due to having high energy/low emotional energy cycles. 

I'm sure there are tons of other things but that's a little snapshot of things that are on a constant churn with other things on an ongoing basis. But the thing is, even though I know I am emotionally exhausted, I can't just turn this off. I'm not choosing to think these things or experience these things, my big dumb brain is and I can't switch it off, except if I drink, but then I can't exercise which makes things a bit better when I can get the strength to get up and do it. But hey maybe that's just trading short term "not feeling"ness for long term "potentially slightly better"ness?

So yeah, I'm exhausted, empty, defeated etc. but it's also not done yet. I'm caught in the middle of a mental riot and I'm going to take a few more knocks before I make it out safely. So, I just have to keep going and there isn't a damn thing that can be done about that so let's get fucking on with it. But hey it's pretty dangerous to go into a riot without a way to fighting your way out so in conclusion,

## What the fuck am I going to do about this?

Gotta have a plan, gotta have a scheme, gotta try and reach your dreams or you'll burst apart at the seams. Or drink yourself into a fat horrible cretin forever doomed to wallow in your own self-pity trapped in a cell of your own mind not able to speak to anyone until the seas of abject misery and depression swallow you entirely. I joke.

I'm not going to for some grand reinvention of the self where I walk down the street and people don't recognise me. Most people currently don't recognise me, I'm a complete stranger to them, but I mean like people who know me. 

I don't have all the answers to this right now and it'll change over time but as of right now I need to,

1. eat better, more regularly, stop going days without food
2. drink less
3. write more (this has helped, go figure)
4. keep doing the running even if I want to just curl up in a pityball
5. be a better dad

I need to measure these things so at the high level,

1. Lose 8kg (just over a stone) which brings me to my target weight
2. Run 2000 kilometers this year. Double last year
3. Try and write an article at least once every 3 weeks. At the very least publically record how far I am in achieving my goals and if they are helping.
4. Create a dadops board to plan and track structured activity with my kids. Oh, I can write about that too.
5. Limit my drinking to "proper" nights out. Aim for say - at most 2 nights a week? No in-house drinking, really cut back on the "just 1 after work" drinks. Shit like that.
6. Track my moods

Now the 6th one requires a bit of work. I have yet to find a service that just allows me to records how I feel (like a value and descriptive emotions) along with reasons why this is the case. So, I've started one. It's nearly ready for personal consumption and dog-fooding and I'd like to eventually turn it into a real-life service that people can use to provide analytics over their moods and what causes them. If you got this far and are still reading and would like to help.... well shucks get in touch

Have at thee, future!
