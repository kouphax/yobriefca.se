<p>So I've decided to go ahead and move away from <a href="http://yobriefcase.posterous.com">Posterous</a> - the call of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> was just too much.  I've migrated a lot of my content but there is some dodgy formatting and plenty of missing images so I am in the process of sorting everything out.</p><p>Also thanks to <a href="http://tombell.org.uk">Tom Bell</a> for letting me use his template.</p>
