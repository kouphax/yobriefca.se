<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/getexcitedandmakethings.png" style="border:15px solid white;"></p><p>Not generally a fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On">Keep Calm and Carry On</a> parodies but this one pretty much sums up how I feel about my job/career type thingies and well worth a mention.
