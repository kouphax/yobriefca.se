## Description

MonoTouch allows you to harness all those C# skills and most of those handy .NET/Mono libraries to create truly native apps for iOS with a sprinkle of cross-platform support. But why not just use objective-c you cry? Choice is nice, so is C# and so is the range of libraries available for mono!

In this talk I will dive in to what makes MonoTouch so compelling for .NET developers wanting to break into iOS development and even how these skills can be harnessed to create cross platform native applications for iOS, Android and WP7 through a shared codebase.
