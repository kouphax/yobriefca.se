<p><span class="caps">SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENCASTS</span> <span class="caps">GALORE</span>!</p><p>So I unveiled the new <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> section of the site.  Can you guess whats in it?  Those who said "screencasts" you can have a nice non-patronising pat on the head.  The rest of you&#8230;. for shame.  Tut tut.</p><p>Anyways I wanted to start a series of short <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> that will provide a practical view of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> Micro Web Framework series.  So far I've managed to cover the basics of <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> but there is more to come.</p>
