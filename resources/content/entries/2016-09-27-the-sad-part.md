I'm not writing this for some shitty internet pity points, I'm writing it as I think it's an essential part in a process that I am making up as I go along. Maybe I'll delete this some day, but probably not.

Long story short - just over a week ago my wife and I decided our marriage wasn't working anymore so we decided to dissolve it. This isn't any sort of kneejerk reaction we've been trying to make it work since late last year when we first realised this wasn't working. We're still working out how this is all going to work but anything we do will be gradual, we've got kids and first and foremost their needs come first in this whole thing. We've spoken with them and they seem to understand. It helps that the relationship between my wife and I is still good, we're friends we just lack anything required to hold together an intimate relationship. Of course that doesn't really make it any less shitty but it's going to make everything much smoother... I think, I've (thankfully) never been in this position.

So hey ho, it is what it is, lets see if we can't turn this into some bizarre opportunity to improve our quality of life.
