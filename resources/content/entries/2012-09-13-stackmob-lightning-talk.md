So I finally found an opportunity to deliver a quick lightning talk on [StackMob](http://stackmob.com) at our
monthly CodeSlice sessions in work.  Knocked it up today over lunch and presented it tonight.  Would like to
pull this one out into a more in depth and interactive look... just waiting for someone to ask :)
