You can stand at the station and wait for the train.  You know the one. It's the one that's always late, always packed with people, head down staring at the ground.  Or, you can walk the tracks with your own two feet. When you walk the tracks you take in your surroundings, you understand the route and you see the alternatives.  You wont beat the train everytime but when you walk the tracks you'll have better stories to tell when you get there.
