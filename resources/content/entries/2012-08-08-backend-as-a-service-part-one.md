I recently wrote an article for [CloudSpring](http://cloudspring.com/) (a part of the [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) family) around what you can expect and what you should think about when going for one of the "Backend as a Service" offerings on the market.  

The article is [now live](http://cloudspring.com/backend-as-a-service-part-1/).

Part 2, the one where I look at whats actually out there, will be ready within the next week.
