<p>I've just pushed the first draft of the new shiny Baler web site into the various tubes that form the basis of the interwebs.  I am still missing a logo but why let that hold me back?  Anyway feel free to check it out while I add more tests to the project and generally polish things.</p><p><a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler">Baler Project Site</a></p>
