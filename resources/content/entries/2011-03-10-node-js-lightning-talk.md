<p><p>So I held a lightning talk on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> the  other day.  A lightning talk is essentially a short (15 minute) talk about a  subject with a bit of discussion at the end of it.  There was a slight technical  hitch in that I forgot to record the session but I have made up for it by  sitting alone in a quiet room early this morning a re-recorded the session &ndash;  minus the actual discussion bit.</p><p>Obviously it's not as good as the original talk but thought it might be worth  putting out there anyway as it's better than the slides alone.  So here it is &ndash;  a very high level view of node.js.</p><h2>Video</h2><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/20868544?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe><h2>Slides</h2><p><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=node-lightning-talk-110310015300-phpapp02&stripped_title=nodejs-lightning-talk"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=node-lightning-talk-110310015300-phpapp02&stripped_title=nodejs-lightning-talk" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" height="417" width="500"></object></p></p>
