## Description

Mobile development is a bit like writing web apps back in the browser war days - full of decision anxiety, volatility and platform specific issues. There is no one true answer yet most people think there should be. This talk will cover the popular(ish) options from native all the way to web solutions (and all the mashup magic in-between). Oh yes and some opinion as well.

This is the longer more up to date version of the previous talk.
