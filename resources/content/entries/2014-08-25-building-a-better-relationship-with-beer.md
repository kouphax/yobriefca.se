FYI I drink.  Probably more than I reasonably should considering I'm trying the drop a few pounds gained from over indulging in booze and food.  I can, for the most part, control my eating throughout the day but my one vice always seems to be drinking.  I enjoy the hell out of it.  I like trying new beers as is evidenced by [my untappd profile](https://untappd.com/user/kouphax) but I also really enjoy everything else. 

So I've decided to decrease the quantity and increase the quality.  No more Olde English (which is actually my prefered cider, it also happens to be pretty cheap) and instead calculated trips to the Vineyard on Ormeau Road for a small selection of carefully curated beer.  To kind of round out the whole experience (yes, I realise how pretentious this sounds) I want to record tasting notes on the sessions here (as well as [Untappd](https://untappd.com/)).  

In theory that should reduce my intake to, at most, 3 times a month.
