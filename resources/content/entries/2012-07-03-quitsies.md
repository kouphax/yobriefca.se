This more of an FYI to anyone who may read this blog than a horrible diatribe about how I am wasting my life with meaningless exercises or technologies I'll never get to use to a bunch of people that don't really care, what would be the point?  Plus - it's probably not even true. 

So rather than pottering on about cool and interesting technologies that will make everyones (read, developers) life infinitely better 100% guaranteed I've decided to devote my time to, 

1. Working on some startup-py type things that have been milling around the back of my head for some time, and, 
2. Generally getting stuff done 

Yep, like a hipster band, this little testament to bike-shedding is going on indefinite hiatus.
