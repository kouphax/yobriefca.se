I have procrastinated long enough on this and it was blocking some of the other work I wanted to get on with.  I have just pushed v0.1 to Nuget and launched the [site sans documentation](http://yobriefca.se/projects/fluentauth/).

<!--more-->

Not a great deal has changed since my last announcement, well it has but it hasn't been documented as it should be backwards compatible.  Just a few more configuration options that I'll explain once I get the documentation rolled out.

<script type="text/javascript">
    (function () {
        var nb = document.createElement('script'); nb.type = 'text/javascript'; nb.async = true;
        nb.src = 'http://s.prabir.me/nuget-button/0.2.1/nuget-button.min.js';
        var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(nb, s);
    })();
</script>
<pre class="nuget-button">Install-Package Tinyweb.FluentAuth</pre>


So go check it out and hopefully you'll find it useful - plenty of plans for expansion to other frameworks and some more API changes coming too.  Now back to procrastinating.
