  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as I&#8217;ve already said in a <a href="/blog/2011/08/29/hackathon-retorspective/">previous post</a> our first hackathon was well recieved.  So why not, we thought, do another one?  And indeed why not?</p>

<p>This time we are changing things up.  Rather than everyone coming together to bang out a solution we are going to have small teams working on the same project on different mobile platforms.  With musical chairs.  Yeah you heard right right.  Musical Chairs.  Kind of.</p>

<p>Heres the deal</p>

<ul>
<li>A number of stations are set up in a room.</li>
<li>Each station is set up to host a particular development platform (iOS Native, Android Native, PhoneGap, Web, Windows Phone 7 etc.).</li>
<li>Each station will have 2 x Developers assigned to them for pairing and 1 X Technology Expert that will act as an advisory role for that stations technology platform</li>
<li>There will be 1 product owner and 1 idea.</li>
<li>Each station will produce the solution in the best way possible for that platform</li>
</ul>


<p>Now here&#8217;s the catch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Development will be done in sprints lasting 1 hour.  At the end of the sprint the 2 devs at each station get up and move to the next station giving a 5 minute handover to the next team.  This keeps happneing until the Hackathon (24hrs this time) is over.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thats the musical chairs bit.  But why?  Well this allows people to get some exposure to each platform, see the relevant pain points and above all else learn to work as a team rather than being a bunch of selfish pricks (#joke).  Sure the first full cycle will probably be painful for most people but like women who live in the same house - after the first cycle everyone should be roughly in sync (#jokeagain).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a grand idea but it&#8217;s easily broken.  We need to prevent that happening.  Here&#8217;s how I think we can do that.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>People</strong>.  People are key to this one.  More specifically numbers.  We need 3 people per station and 1 product owner.  If people drop out we have to start cutting stations, if numbers aren&#8217;t right some teams will be too big/small and that wont work.  We got 12 people last time which dropped to about 6 after 24 hours because some people just couldn&#8217;t hack the pace.  this time people need to commit and stay commited or we fail and that would suck!</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong>.  Everything needs to be ready for this one.  It&#8217;s got a mobile focus and that should remain the focus.  This means all the backend services need to be available and working upfront.  This means user stories need to be defined beforehand and even a few broken down into tasks so devs can get cracking immediatley while the rest are fleshed out.  This means stations needs to be up and running with everything installed and working.  So lots to do.</li>
<li><strong>Server/Services</strong>.  As I&#8217;ve said these need to be in place and rather than roll our own we are looking at the potentially awesome <a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse</a> as it will have everything we need for all platforms thanks to the minimum of a RESTful API.  Still under review but it&#8217;s looking good so far</li>
<li><strong>Idea</strong>.  We need an idea that is sufficiently small but also feature rich enough to make the implementations different (device integration etc.).  We have some but we need to narrow this down to something that would be beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>.  All the infrastructure needs to be in place.  All dev software installed, source control ready, <a href="http://agilezen.com/">AgileZen</a> subscriptions bought, test devices ready blah blah blah</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more - I mean it&#8217;s early days.</p>

<p>So that is where we are right now, lots to think about and lots to do.  We are aiming for a November/December slot if we can get the people and a weekend they are all free.  Excited++.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Where WebForms was an attempt to bring the desktop paradigm to web development Windows 8 attempts to do the exact opposite by bringing web to the desktop. More so in fact Windows 8 appears to be effectivley deprecating the desktop idea over time. It&#8217;s a bold move but trying to cater to every platform is surely a recipe for disaster but you know what I can&#8217;t help but like it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not convinced by the Vista v2 arguments either but then I do most of my &#8220;poweruser&#8221; stuff via a command prompt and thats not going to change - when I hit the desktop I am looking for a nice experience and I feel, so far, I get that with Windows 8.</p>

<p>Being an idiot I managed to grab the ISO without VS11/Blend 5 on it so I am waiting for that one to download before sharing opinions on them (Blend 5 surely must be just like Dreamweaver but I stand to be proven wrong).  I am told, however, the first options on the New Project dialog in VS11 are JavaScript projects - I like that. :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the process of <a href="/blog/2011/09/01/tinkering-with-agility/">researching Agility</a> I needed to throw together a quick serverside stack to accept the RESTful calls from Agility.  I went with my current framework de jour <a href="https://github.com/martinrue/Tinyweb">Tinyweb</a> and I must admit it was a great call.  For more basic info on Tinyweb check out my <a href="/blog/2011/07/18/micro-web-frameworks-101-tinyweb/">blog post</a></p>

<p>Agility by default routes the RESTful requests to <code>api/model/{id}</code> and Tinyweb let me create a handler associated with this sort of url by way of areas.</p>

<h2>Areas</h2>

<p>Tinyweb has a feature I wasn;t aware of before.  It is possible to register a handlers namespace as an &#8220;area&#8221; (if you have experience with ASP.NET MVC you&#8217;ll know what that means).</p>

<pre><code>Tinyweb.Areas.Add("Agility.Tinkerings.Web.Handlers.Api", "api");
</code></pre>

<p>This means that even though my handler is call <code>TodoHandler</code> the url would map to the one above without having to sacrifice naming style of the handler or force us to create a custom route variable in each handler that had to map to this area.  Flippin clever stuff</p>

<h2>WebActivator</h2>

<p>Another excellent Nuget package is the <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/WebActivator">WebActivator</a> and I have been charmed by it&#8217;s slickness recently.  WebActivator allows you to attribute a class/namespace and specify what code should be run when the application starts.  So rather than having to put in a load of lines for configuring different aspects of your stack into <code>Global.asax.cs</code> you can break them into distinct classes and avoid breaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP</a> more than you have too.  Here is the example I used in the Agility.js source</p>

<pre><code>[assembly: WebActivator.PostApplicationStartMethod(typeof(TinywebActivator), "Activate")]
namespace Agility.Tinkerings.Web.Activators
{
    public class TinywebActivator
    {
        public static void Activate()
        {
            Tinyweb.Areas.Add("Agility.Tinkerings.Web.Handlers.Api", "api");
            Tinyweb.Init();
        }
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p> I don&#8217;t even have a <code>Global.asax</code> defined at all.</p>

<p> Feel free to poke around the source to get a better picture of how I threw the backend together.  Thanks go to <a href="https://github.com/martinrue/Tinyweb">Tinyweb</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/martinrue">@martinrue</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having spent a few days tinkering with <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> I have come to the following conclusions</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s a bit buggy in places (it is currently on v0.1 so this is to be expected)</li>
<li>At first glance code written against <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> looks like a total mess though it appears to be a weird optical illusion because once you grasp the <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> approach the code makes total sense</li>
<li><a href="http://agilityjs.com/">Agility</a> would fit well into an existing codebase as much as into a new one.  Certainly more so that some of the other frameworks.  And finally,</li>
<li>I like it</li>
</ol>


<p>You could almost class <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> as a micro MVC framework (and we all know how I like them).  I say that because it takes an incredibly simple approach to MVC as well as offering a very small but (IMHO) complete feature set.  Unlike <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockout</a>, which also makes use of the <code>data-</code> attributes for model binding (and more), <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">agility.js</a> uses the <code>data-bind</code> attribute for model binding and thats it.</p>

<p>With Agility you have that ability to compose UI&#8217;s from discrete little self-contained, and/or nested agility objects that behave as standalone MVC implementations.  This is <em>kind of</em> different to the standard appraoch of other MVC-like JS frameworks which generally go for the create a single large MVC architecture and manage components within that architecture.  I am not saying this appraoch is forbidden or impossible in the other frameworks - it&#8217;s just not how a noob would go about things.  At least I never did when I first started looking at them.</p>

<p>To play with agility I went ahead and created &#8220;yet another Todo app&#8221; (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/agility-tinkering">source</a>) complete with server side persistence and some responsive UI elements (Complete button will vanish when a Todo is completed - wow).  I&#8217;ll not break the entire thing down here but here are some choice cuts (in CoffeeScript cause I am THAT cool)</p>

<pre><code>todo = $$ 
  model: {}, 
  view:
    format: '''
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span data-bind="description"/&gt;
        &lt;button class="complete-task"&gt;Complete&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button class="delete-task"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    ''',
  controller: 
    'create': -&gt; 
      @view.$().toggleClass "task-done", @model.get("complete")
    'change:complete': -&gt; 
      @view.$().addClass "task-done"
    'click .complete-task': -&gt;  
      @model.set "complete": true
      @persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
      @save()
    'click .delete-task': -&gt;  
      @persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
      @erase()
</code></pre>

<p>The code above shows the creation of a Todo entity i.e. a single entry in the list.  <code>$$</code> is the Agility factory method and will create an MVC based entity out of the object passed in.  I have decalred a view, a model (albeit empty) and a controller with an assortment of tasks for the entity.</p>

<p>This will give you two-way model binding, event wiring up and even custom events totally for free plus a very simple way to react to events.  The controller is essentially the event handler so things like <code>click .delete-task</code> will bind the handler to the click event of the element with the <code>delete-task</code> class (the typical full range of selectors are available thanks to jQuery, Zepto integration forthcoming too).  Events like <code>create</code> and <code>change:complete</code> are custom events given to us by agility and allow us to listen to key points in the lifecycle of the object.  In fact <code>change:complete</code> is a demonstration of something truly awesome (IMHO as usual).  The <code>change</code> event will fire when model properties are changed - the <code>change:&lt;property_name&gt;</code> will only fire when the <code>complete</code> property changes.  Noice!</p>

<p>My Todo list object then creates instances of the <code>todo</code> object above after pulling the info from the server.  It uses agility&#8217;s inheritance strategy to to create them from the <code>todo</code> prototype I pass in</p>

<pre><code>todos = $$
  model: {},
  view: 
    format: '''
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="newItem" /&gt;
        &lt;button class="add-task"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;ol/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    '''
  controller:
    'click .add-task': -&gt; 
      item = @view.$('#newItem').val()
      if item isnt ""               
        newTodo = $$ todo, description: item
        newTodo.persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
        newTodo.save()
        @empty()
        @gather todo, 'append', 'ol'
</code></pre>

<p>Next I append the <code>todos</code> object to the document (which renders it and wires things up)</p>

<pre><code>$$.document.append todos
</code></pre>

<p>Persistance is provided as a plugin of sorts with ability to provide your own adapters.  You get a RESTful ajax adapter with Agility.  I use this to provide persistence methods on my objects and let agility set that up.</p>

<pre><code>todo.persist $$.adapter.restful, collection:'todos'
todos.persist()
</code></pre>

<p>There does seem to be a bug with the factory method and persitance enabled object forcing me to call <code>persist</code> prior to any sort of persitence operation but hopefully we will see that resolved soon.</p>

<p>Finally I fetch from the server and wipe the awesome sauce from my lips and beard.</p>

<pre><code>todos.gather todo, 'append', 'ol'
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ve went on more than I wanted to but hey it&#8217;s worth it.  Hopefully this has helped clarify agility to a few people or at least got people intrigued.  Feel free to pull down the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/agility-tinkering">source</a> and have a go yourself otherwise pop on over to the <a href="http://agilityjs.com/">Agility.js</a> site and read the excellent docs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>So my first ever Hackathon (48hr) is done and dusted and has been for over a week (lazy!!).  All in all it was a great experience and plenty of stuff was learnt &#8211; we got some technology evaluation (good and bad), ways we could streamline the process and things that burnt time way too fast.</p><p>This event was intended as a kind of dry run to see if there is any benefit in Kainos running more events of this nature.  Perhaps external ones for charity or educational endeavor.  Does that mean I&#8217;ll be doing it again?  Hope so.  I guess the best question to ask then is what did I want to get out of it.  Well I went in a bit open minded &#8211; mainly I wanted to have the experience but I also wanted to try and get some of the techs I have been tinkering with and see how they faired in a semi-real life environment.  I think I actually wanted to have produced something really usable too but perhaps I was expecting too much?  I mean what we produced wasn&#8217;t a total failure but it needs a lot of work.</p><h1>The End Result</h1><p>We ended up producing a web app for giving continuous feedback to colleagues.  The idea was to allow people to give and ask for feedback as well as facilitating a more formal career review workflow.  Social appraisals as it were.</p><p><img src="/images/appraisr.png" alt="" style="width:100%;"></p><p>We had some basic features such as integrated Windows Authentication and user information look up etc, autocomplete on peoples name, pretty relative time output and some commenting features.  So yeah it&#8217;s pretty sparse but hey it&#8217;s a start.  Whats more interesting is the process and things we observed.</p><h1>The Story</h1><p>The team was a mix of Technical Architects, placement students, software and senior software engineers and even a project manager we had a few no shows and a few people who intended to drop in for a while and leave again.  We also had a person who thought going out the night before was a good idea &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t (hahaha sucker).  But hey at least he showed up.  I have no problem with people not turning up as long as they let someone know but not turning up and not telling me&#8230;. bad form folks.</p><p>Anyway the majority of us gathered in our office at 9ish on Saturday morning and started pitching ideas to attempt.  We ended up with a decent pile of good ideas and started aggressively throwing ideas in the bin until, after some debate, we ended up with the one we decided to run with.  After that we started thrashing out user stories as a group and ended up with a decent amount. The whole process, including getting food, took about 3 or 4 hours.  We then all got stuck into various tasks, I started getting the build server functioning, a few people sat with the product owner and started fleshing out the user stories, a few people looked at the domain model and some people started writing acceptance tests.  This was the bit that cost us a lot of time.  Rather than each person or group working on vertical slice through the system we went horizontally and started arguing over things that never even made it into the end solution.  Everyone fell into their comfort zone cause thats the way Kainos projects typically run &#8211; old school waterfall for the most part.  So yeah no <span class="caps">REAL</span> work actually got done, people were just keen to start and I didn&#8217;t really pull it under control until it was just too late .  It would have been nice to have a Scrum Master type person who was overseeing everything too.  I was too busy doing my own horizontal slice :-S.</p><p>So things went on like this for a while, a lot of &#8220;getting things in place&#8221; and some people had to drop off.  Eventually we hit a point when we realised that our rate of work was nowhere near what it should be and something needed to change.  At about this point everyone but me decided to get some shut eye and I slipped my headphones in, played some Bon Iver and got stuck into fleshing out what we already had.  This formed the basis of the work the next day (this was about 4AM on Sunday morning) when the remaining team (5 left out of the initial 12) kicked of the final leg.  Due to our earlier stumble there wasn&#8217;t very much for our product owner/tester to do for most of the day which was a shame.  Eventually we ended up with what you seen above (finishing up at about 6PM on Sunday night).  The Sunday was less frantic, lots of pairing, lots of trying new technologies and was so much more productive</p><h1>The Technologies</h1><p>We used quite an interesting array of technologies</p><ul>	<li><span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span> 3</li>	<li><span class="caps">SQL</span> Server Compact 4 (due to issues with <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server on the last leg)</li>	<li><a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/">PetaPoco</a></li>	<li><a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a></li>	<li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a></li>	<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>	<li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a></li>	<li><a href="https://github.com/dradovic/MigSharp">Mig#</a></li>	<li><a href="https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake">Psake</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> which I have discovered is a massive impediment to writing tests after the silky smooth experience of <a href="http://www.nspec.org/">NSpec</a></li>	<li><a href="http://should.codeplex.com/">Should.Fluent</a></li>	<li>Git</li></ul><p>In terms of supporting technologies we used the awesome AgileZen for our Kanban board and HipChat for some shared chatting (we had Lync but it&#8217;s inability to persist conversations is a deal breaker in my book).  Finally, we used TeamCity as our build and continuous integration server which was a much much better experience than CC.<span class="caps">NET</span></p><h1>Hackathon Review</h1><p>I guess my story above probably sounds more negative than it really was cause thats the way I write.  It wasn&#8217;t &#8211; it was great craic.  We held a review post-hackathon with everyone involved and the following point were raised.</p><h2>Likes</h2><ol>	<li>Experience with new technologies e.g. CoffeeScript, PetaPoco</li>	<li>Experience with things such as user stories, kanban etc.</li>	<li>People got to do things that they just don?t get the chance to do. E.g. Andrew was designing screens.</li>	<li>Pair programming</li>	<li>Great craic!</li></ol><h2>Dislikes</h2><ol>	<li>People didn&#8217;t know what to do when there were bottlenecks</li>	<li>Lunches and dinners were taken at different times. This affected communication.</li>	<li>People thought they weren&#8217;t productive with no/little sleep.</li>	<li>Tester/Product Owner wasn&#8217;t used as much as they could&#8217;ve been on the second day.</li>	<li>Facilities room has a motion sensor on the lights</li>	<li>A yoga mat is not good for sleeping on</li></ol><h2>Improvements</h2><ol>	<li>Add an equivalent of a Scrum master to the team.</li>	<li>Agree an idea prior to the hackathon so it doesn&#8217;t eat into dev time.</li>	<li>Create a couple of use cases going into the hackathon so the dev team don&#8217;t have to wait on  the business people</li>	<li>Set up infrastructure prior to the hackathon</li>	<li>Choose a few technologies before hand so that people can learn a bit about them before. e.g. the software for source control can be decided in advance.</li>	<li>Make sure people aren&#8217;t going to the shops/getting food at different times</li>	<li>Clone James for tech leader/troubleshooter/developer</li>	<li>Have <strong>less</strong> team work. We found that the entire team was focused on some tasks that didn&#8217;t require it because, well, teamwork is great.</li>	<li>Focus on core functionality instead of e.g. logins which can be done later. Or prep login functionality before.</li>	<li>Use hackathon specific machines</li>	<li>If there&#8217;s another weekend hackathon, people should go get some sleep to rest eyes and minds!</li></ol><p>So all in all it was a great learning experience and I don&#8217;t think anyone said &#8220;I&#8217;m never doing that again&#8221; which was a result and I am certain we will attempt something else in a similar vein and take on board all those improvements to produce something that changes the world or something.  So many things to try&#8230;. what you all doing next weekend :-P</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed I didn&#8217;t blog for nearly a whole month.  Thats not like me.  Sure, I have my troughs (and peaks) but in terms of my overall social activity I may as well have been mostly dead.  My lame excuse?  I&#8217;ve been busy.  Yeah just like everybody else I&#8217;ve been working more than usual &#8211; but I&#8217;ve been taught a valuable lesson.  <strong>Fun</strong> is key.</p><p>Over the last month or so I&#8217;ve been gradually building up a collection of in-progress projects &#8211; just like Pokemon.  I was taking new ones on even when it felt risky and assuring people I could get the work done.  My hubris cost me, and others.  I spread myself too thin, I left no time for contingency and eventually I ended up, and this is really the best term for it so excuse the language, &#8220;fucking over&#8221; one of the projects at the worst possible time I can imagine.  I&#8217;ve always prided myself on the fact I can always stay on top of an extremely large amount of work and satisfy all the stakeholders.  I guess now I know my limit and I even have an indicator well before this threshold is met that I need to start waving a red flag &#8211; when it stops being <strong>fun</strong>.</p><p>I enjoy the vast majority of my work, but obviously there are some aspects that less than <strong>fun</strong> (writing documents, estimating etc.)<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  What started happening was I was doing more <strong>non-fun</strong> work that <strong>fun</strong> work (in fact I was doing very little <strong>fun</strong> stuff at all).  This made me less productive, my heart wasn&#8217;t fully in it and so I wasn&#8217;t 100% focused.  I was less able to predict and plan accordingly and as things started happening on one project (on-site customer meetings etc.) another project had to take the hit and eventually one had to give.  The <strong>fun</strong> factor also meant I was taking on extra work in the vain hope that it might be more <strong>fun</strong>, which upon reflection, is pretty damn stupid.  Oh and lets not forget the fact I was holding off talking to people because of some insane belief that there was a good chance that things would look much better in &#8220;another hour or so&#8221;.  Seldom was this the case of course so it mean&#8217;t that I wasn&#8217;t raising flags early enough and people felt I was being aloof.</p><p>So what will I be doing in future?  Well I now have a rule and I will see how it goes.  Simply put,</p><blockquote><p>I will only take on more work if I am currently having <strong>fun</strong> and the new work will not push me into the <strong>not fun</strong> work spectrum.  If I am <strong>not having fun</strong> I can only take on more work when I have cleared some of my work and am back having <strong>fun</strong>.  The closer I get to the <strong>not fun</strong> end of the spectrum the sooner and more frequent communication with stakeholders needs to be.</p></blockquote><p>Simple enough but it seems to hold up so far.</p><ul>	<li>Give me too much <strong>fun</strong> work and it stops being fun because there is too much pressure.</li></ul><ul>	<li>Give me a single <strong>not fun</strong> job that isn&#8217;t fun and I will only accept it provided I can work on my own projects to re-address the <strong>fun</strong> ratio (blogging about experiences, related technologies etc.)</li></ul><p>This probably sounds quite selfish and, well, of course it is.  Nobody should expect me to just do whatever they say<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> without at least making the deal appealing to me or at least allowing me a certain amount of free time to draw my own benefits from the situation.  For example I accept a certain amount of <strong>not fun</strong> work because I am permitted to do a lot of my own <strong>fun</strong> work to address the balance.</p><p>I think I&#8217;ve left this open enough for personal interpretation and flexibility but strict enough that there is a foundation here to aid in making decisions.  If I had applied this rule previously I wouldn&#8217;t have taken the extra work (even though it seemed appealing at the time &#8211; it was <strong>fun</strong> and I got paid overtime for it) and both myself and the project would be in better shape.  But hey how can you ever learn if you never make mistakes?</p><p>Is the word <strong>fun</strong> starting to sound really weird to anyone else?</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> I realise some people <span class="caps">LOVE</span> writing documents and estimating &#8211; I don&#8217;t.  They are just a necessary part of the job that I live with.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> There is only one person that <span class="caps">CAN</span> &#8211; my wife and thats like the law.  The company I work for is great at trying to keep their workforce happy and I am in no way implying that they forced work on me.  They didn&#8217;t.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>Choice and flexibility are good, in fact they a super smashing awesome.  Sort of.  I mean if you go over the top and offer people &#8220;all the choices&#8221; they are going to get all stressed and probably procrastinate until someone else makes the decision for them.  Also if you give them so much flexibility they will probably do things differently each time &#8211; again that is not a great thing either &#8211; for many things in life and IT you shouldn&#8217;t have to make a conscious decision (it&#8217;s probably waste of time in this case).</p><p>I&#8217;ve recently been reviewing my companies default project structure and it&#8217;s full of choice and flexibility and while this can cater for the vast array of different project types in our company it also imposes a certain level of cognitive-tax prior to kicking off any development to get the solution in a position that can be farmed out to the team.  It imposes this tax across <span class="caps">ALL</span> projects even the 99% of the time typical project, with their typical project structure.  It&#8217;s not a costly tax but it&#8217;s unnecessary.  Why not just push it onto the non-standard projects who will likely need to spend time setting things up correctly anyway?  Suck it, weird projects!  Thats what I say.</p><p>To this end I&#8217;ve been trying to build a fairly opinionated project structure (along with some handy tools during the development stage).  Right now it&#8217;s in the early stages and open to abuse/commentary (in fact I&#8217;d welcome it, please) but I thought it makes sense to share it<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> &#8211; for the benefit of myself and others (or selfishly unselfish as I like to call it).</p><h1>Folder Structure</h1><p>I didn&#8217;t want to break from tradition here.  There is exists a fairly standard project structure that is common across many languages and environments and rather than create a clever, verbose structure I reckon it&#8217;s probably best to stick with the tried and tested approach.  That way new developers, regardless of background, shouldn&#8217;t have to wrestle with heavily nested folders or obscure names for folders (SolutionSource vs src) when navigating our solution.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1149975.js?file='></script><noscript><pre><code>  |_ &lt;MySolution&gt;    |_ &lt;lib&gt;	  |_ repositories.config    |_ &lt;src&gt;    |_ &lt;test&gt;	|_ .gitignore			|_ default.ps1		|_ MySolution.sln	|_ nuget.config</code></pre></noscript></p><p>Most of this will be fairly self-explanatory<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> but whats the harm in a little clarification?</p><ul>	<li><code>lib</code> this is the place either myself or Nuget (see nuget.config and default.ps1) will dump any DLLs, tools or other dependencies required by the solution.  As I will talk about later the only file I ever check in here is the repositories.config and have nuget resolve the rest (still some decisions need made around manually referenced files etc.).</li>	<li><code>src</code> hold all the projects that are actually going to be released as part of the final solution.  This folder doesn&#8217;t contain any of the test projects you create for the solution &#8211; no point in muddyinbg the waters.</li>	<li><code>test</code> holds all the solutions projects that we create for running tests (unit, integration etc) to validate the solution.</li></ul><h1>Special Files</h1><p>My default project comes with a number of files that help make developing and building the solution form scratch as easy as it should be.  These files are open to be tweaked to suit the needs of the project as and when necessary.</p><h2>repositories.config</h2><p>This is a file that is used by <a href="http://nuget.org">Nuget</a> to resolve the location of all the package configuration files associated with the projects in a solution (packages.config).  When I start this file is empty but as dependencies are added via <a href="http://nuget.org">Nuget</a> this file is updated to the location of packages.config files within each project (which in turn is used to resolved the necessary <a href="http://nuget.org">Nuget</a> packages that need to be downloaded).  I include this file along with a download task in my <a href="https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake">psake</a> build file (see later) so that we we don&#8217;t have to check-in all those, potentially large, dlls and tools into our <acronym title="Version Control System"><span class="caps">VCS</span></acronym> &#8211; it&#8217;s slow and annoying.  As a bonus when using some VCS&#8217;s (e.g. git) this file will ensure the lib folder is committed to source control even thought it is technically empty &#8211; keeping our project structure intact.</p><h2>.gitignore</h2><p>Used to ignore certain generated and user specific files when using the git version control system.  Keeps things nice and clean and reduces annoying unnecessary conflicts.  As with most solutions out there I ignore the following patterns by default,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1150000.js?file='></script><noscript><pre><code>binobj*.suo*.csproj.user*.cachelib/*/</code></pre></noscript></p><h2>nuget.config</h2><p>I&#8217;ll jump onto the meat of the files, default.ps1, shortly but first as you can probably guess by now I assume the use of <a href="http://nuget.org">Nuget</a>.  It&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s great and thats all I want to say on that matter.  <code>nuget.config</code> is a simple file that tells <a href="http://nuget.org">Nuget</a> (even within Visual Studio) to put all it&#8217;s downloaded files into the lib directory rather than the default <code>packages</code> folder.  Everyone understands what <code>lib</code> is, less people &#8211; packages.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1150006.js?file='></script><noscript><pre><code>&lt;settings&gt;	&lt;repositoryPath&gt;lib&lt;/repositoryPath&gt;<p><p></code></pre></noscript></p><h2>default.ps1</h2><p>I&#8217;ve decided to run with <a href="https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake">psake</a> to coordinate and perform my builds.  MSBuild, while useful, is ridden with sickeness I call <span class="caps">XML</span> (<span class="caps">BTW</span> everyone else calls it <span class="caps">XML</span> too <span class="caps">AFAIK</span>).  It&#8217;s a beast to get right.  <a href="https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake">Psake</a> on the other hand is pure script.  It&#8217;s more succinct and you can even debug it &#8211; how awesome is that?  So <code>default.ps1</code> is my <a href="https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake">psake</a> based build file.  What does it look like currently?

  <div class="entry-content">  <blockquote class="announce">This post is the is part of series of posts covering the various <em>micro web frameworks</em> in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.  The frameworks I intend to cover will be linked as the series progresses.  For further discussion on the use of micro web framework in .<span class="caps">NET</span> please see my <a href="/blog/2011/05/18/why-use-micro-web-frameworks-in-net/">previous post</a> The current series line up:<ul>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/19/micro-web-frameworks-101-jessica/">Jessica</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/23/micro-web-frameworks-101-nancy/">Nancy</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/06/22/micro-web-frameworks-101-anna/">Anna</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/07/18/micro-web-frameworks-101-tinyweb//">Tinyweb</a><br></li></ul></blockquote><p>Tinyweb takes a slightly different view than the other web frameworks I have talked about.  In fact it takes a fairly opinionated approach to the way your structure your applications code and forces you to think in terms of resource endpoints rather then big monolithic modules or controllers.  It&#8217;s certainly true that projects based on the other frameworks such as Nancy and Jessica can be architected in such a way but Tinyweb ensures that you don&#8217;t start cutting corners and making allowances for lazy code by simply not providing the ability to do it!</p><h2>Getting Started &#8211; Hello World</h2><p>Lets get Tinyweb first from good old reliable Nuget,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1101809.js?file=Install.ps1'></script><noscript><pre><code>Install-Package Tinyweb</code></pre></noscript> <p>With Tinyweb installed we can go ahead and create a <code>RootHandler</code> this name is the one exception to the Tinyweb handler naming convention which I&#8217;ll touch on in a minute.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1101814.js?file=RootHandler.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class RootHandler{    public IResult Get()    {        return Result.String("Hello World");    }}</code></pre></noscript><p>In our handler I also defined the a <code>Get</code> method which returns an IResult this will act as our endpoint.  One last thing before we magic up a web page is to initialise Tinyweb via our <code>Global.asax.cs</code> so Tinyweb can do its bootstrapping discovery voodoo stuffs.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1101802.js?file=Global.asax.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class Global : HttpApplication{    protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)    {        Tinyweb.Init();    }}</code></pre></noscript> <p>Et voila! Run the app and once again we have a hello world.</p><h2>Tinyweb Features</h2><p>Even in that small Hello World example there are plenty of Tinyweb features but you&#8217;ll also notice that Tinyweb really doesn&#8217;t get in the way at all.</p><h3>Handlers</h3><p>Each Tinyweb Handler represents a single resource endpoint.  With the exception of <code>RootHandler</code> the <span class="caps">URL</span> endpoint for each handler is inferred from the name of the handler.  For example a handler named <code>HelloHandler</code> will react to <code>/hello</code>, <code>HelloWorldHandler</code> will react to <code>/hello/world</code>.  You can see from these examples that casing of the handler name is important in terms of the url endpoint generation.</p><p>The next thing about handlers is that they respond to 4 methods each one corresponding to the 4 main Http Verbs &#8211; <code>Get()</code>, <code>Post()</code>, <code>Put()</code> and <code>Delete</code> &#8211; the only requirement of these is that they return an <code>IResult</code></p><h3>Model Binding and Arguments</h3><p>Model binding is also provided by handlers actions &#8211; just pass in an object and Tinyweb will do it&#8217;s best to bind request values to this object (accepts primitives, collections and plain C# objects).</p><p>Alternatively if you want to do some work under the hood you can make sure the <code>RequestContext</code> is passed in by simply passing it instead.  This gives you access to the bowels of the request to do with what you please.</p><h3>Advanced Routes</h3><p>It&#8217;s also possible to override the default routing convention by declaring a handler level variable called <code>route</code> of type <code>Route</code>.  This example shows how we can override handlers default route <code>/hello/world</code> and go with the more understandable &#8220;/helloworld&#8221;.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102490.js?file=HelloWorldHandler.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class HelloWorldHandler{    Route route = new Route("helloworld");    public IResult Get()    {        return Result.String("Hello World");    }}</code></pre></noscript><h3>Route Parameters</h3><p>In the spirit of RESTFulness you may also want to accept parameters as part of your <span class="caps">URL</span> and we can do that as well with this <code>route</code> class as well as optionally suppling default values for parameters,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102494.js?file=HelloWorldHandler.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class HelloWorldHandler{    Route route = new Route("hello/{name}");    // OR WITH A DEFAULT VALUE FOR PARAMS    Route route = new Route("hello/{name}", new { name = "World" });    public IResult Get(string name)    {        return Result.String("Hello " + name);    }}</code></pre></noscript><p>A powerful little approach.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>All Tinyweb results (e.g. what the response returns) implement the <code>IResult</code> interface so it&#8217;s simple enough to implement your own custom result type though it is probably unnecessary for the most part as Tinyweb offers a range of result types straight away via the <code>Result</code> classes static methods.</p><ul>	<li>String</li>	<li>File</li>	<li>Json</li>	<li><span class="caps">XML</span></li>	<li>JsonOrXml (returns either Json or <span class="caps">XML</span> depending on the request headers)</li>	<li>Html</li>	<li>Redirect (to a specific handler or <span class="caps">URL</span>)</li></ul><p>Tinyweb also offers a <code>View</code> class that can render views written with Spark and Razor so rendering a view can be as simple as</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102510.js?file=HelloWorldHandler.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class HelloWorldHandler{    Route route = new Route("hello/{name}", new { name = "World" });    public IResult Get(string name)    {        return View.Razor&lt;string&gt;(name, "hello.cshtml");    }}</code></pre></noscript><h3>Filters</h3><p>Filters allow us to intercept requests both before and after they are processed on both a per handler and global level.</p><p>Each handler can optionally contain an <code>After</code> and/or a <code>Before</code> method that will, not surprisingly, be called after and before each handler request (I&#8217;ll let you guess which one does which) e.g.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102652.js?file=RootHandler.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class RootHandler{    public void Before()    {        Logger.Log("Before Executed");    }    public IResult Get()    {        return Result.String("Hello World");    }    public void After()    {        Logger.Log("After Executed");    }}</code></pre></noscript><p>Alternatively if you want the same before or after filter applied across all handlers you can create a Filter class by creating a class appended with the word <code>Filter</code>.  We can recreate the same handler above with a global filter for logging,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102658.js?file=Filter.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class LoggingFilter{    public void Before()    {        Logger.Log("Before Executed");    }    public void After()    {        Logger.Log("After Executed");    }}public class RootHandler{    public IResult Get()    {        return Result.String("Hello World");    }}</code></pre></noscript><p><code>Before</code> and <code>After</code> methods can also return <code>IResult</code> objects if you want to work with the actual response.</p><h3>Error Handling and Debugging</h3><p>Not all of us write flawless code and so sometimes things go south and exceptions start throwing their weight around.  Tinyweb has a global hook that is useful for capturing such errors as they bubble up to the surface.  The TinyWeb class has a static property <code>OnError</code> that accepts an Action that can be used to handle the exception e.g.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1102667.js?file=Global.asax.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e){    Tinyweb.Init();    Tinyweb.OnError = (exception, context, data) =&gt;    {        Logger.Log(exception);    };}</code></pre></noscript><p>Another useful tool when debugging your app is the <code>Tinyweb.WhatHaveIGot()</code>.  It&#8217;s a convenience method that can be used to print out all the matched routes and filters.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>On the surface the focus of Tinyweb may seem only moderately different from other frameworks but after playing with it for a while it become apparent that the opinionated approach really makes you think about your projects structure and <span class="caps">API</span>.  I&#8217;m certainly of the opinion that this is a damn good thing<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  Tinyweb gives me just enough framework to do pretty much everything I need &#8211; which I would expect from a real micro-framework.  On top of that it&#8217;s flexible and intuitive and another handy utility in my tool belt.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> I&#8217;ve already said that it is possible to make the likes of Nancy and Jessica behave in this, either by ensuring that all module adhere to this pattern, or creating an abstract base class that enforces this sort of structure so I am in no way bashing the alternatives.  I like choice.</p></div>
