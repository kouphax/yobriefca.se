  <div class="entry-content">  <div class="update"><p>This post is a bit of a brain dump so expect some incoherence and repetition.  I&#8217;m buzzed on coffee and feel like a kid in a toy shop so I just want to get it out there and if anyone has any experience of hackathons feel free to pitch in.  In fact please do :)</p><p>Also sorry for the blogging overload.</p></div><h2>Background</h2><p>So I recently started walking to and from work.  The walk is about 3.5 miles which takes about 50 minutes.  This gives me a lot of time to think, even over think but even I bore myself sometimes so I decided to give podcasts a try.  I grabbed a load of <a href="http://hanselminutes.com">Hanselminutes</a> and <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a> episodes to maybe learn something new.  One of the <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a> podcasts really caught my attention &#8211; <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=310">109: Harmony Hackathon</a>.  The podcast tells the story of a group of people that got together and spent 48 hours designing and developing a solution for a charity organisation.  I&#8217;ve heard of hackathons before but hearing these guys talk about their experiences while using a technology stack that is my bread and butter (.<span class="caps">NET</span>) just got me all tingly inside.</p><p>I wanted to do this.  I know it sounds pathetic but the experience of hashing something out, cutting code and working totally agile without the bureaucracy of management slowing things up<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> sounds really fun to me.  I tend to get bored on long running projects.  I really want to try new things in real projects but convincing managers or customers is a near impossible task as the &#8220;play it safe&#8221; attitude makes a lot more sense to them.  Come on guys who cares about money when there is fun to be had?</p><p>So anyway this got me thinking.  How would I go about this, why would I go about this and how would I get other people to give 24 or 48 straight hours of their life for something like this?  I mean I live in Belfast, Northern Ireland not exactly a <span class="caps">MAJOR</span> hub of geek activity.</p><h2>Hackathon Goals</h2><p>So why would we do this?  Having clear goals upfront is really going help sell this to people.  They will also act as guidance and help drive the entire event to the finish line.  There are plenty of reasons, perhaps even contradictory ones,</p><ul>	<li>A finished product or prototype</li>	<li>Education of technologies and techniques</li>	<li>The experience</li>	<li>Technology evaluation</li>	<li>Networking</li>	<li>Something to put on your CV</li></ul><p>I realise that much of this is done on a per person basis but unless each persons goals are aligned in some way there is a risk the whole thing would fall apart.  Personally I think people wanting to leverage it for any sort of networking, CV building or taking unfounded punts on technology need not apply.  I am not adverse to a bit of risk taking in the technology stakes but they need to be calculated risks rather than a <em>&#8220;ohhh shiny lets use this&#8221;</em> attitude.  If it&#8217;s putting all the other goals at risk it&#8217;s not worth it.</p><ul>	<li>A finished product or prototype</li>	<li>Education of technologies and techniques</li>	<li>The experience</li>	<li><del>Technology evaluation</del></li>	<li><del>Networking</del></li>	<li><del>Something to put on your CV</del></li></ul><p>I&#8217;d be happy working with people who agree with me on at least 2 of the points above.  But of course this isn&#8217;t a hard and fast rule and I remain open for the greater good.</p><h2>The Idea</h2><p>So what would we do?  I don&#8217;t think it would work very well if we just played around with some technologies and produced a few prototypes.  No, addressing a real work problem or need that is of sufficient size and complexity that allows us to drive a spike right through the entire solution gives us something to work towards.  Actually producing something that works or at least proves that the idea is viable seems almost mandatory.  The thought of walking away after the 24 or 48 hours with something that you can show people is a noble goal.  Whether that be for charity, something internal for your company or something for the open source community.</p><p>I have plenty of ideas I would go for but this isn&#8217;t a dictatorship (not at this point anyway) this is only going to work if people feel really involved, after all when the &#8220;mid way slump&#8221; starts kicking in you&#8217;re only going to make it through if you <span class="caps">WANT</span> it to work and are invested in experience.  I guess what I am saying is you&#8217;d get people together &#8211; potential developers, product owners, investors up front and brainstorm, plan and argue.  This brings me on to another point&#8230;.</p><h2>The 7 P&#8217;s</h2><p>Prior Preparation and Planning Prevent Piss Poor Performance.  The more I think about this hackathon thing the more I come to the conclusion that it is so much bigger than the 24 or 48 hours of design and development.  Like all good adventures you have to go in prepared.  What would you need upfront?</p><ul>	<li>You need your goals clearly defined</li>	<li>You need a few user stories so there is something for people to do while things are getting established</li>	<li>You need your stack and approach mapped out (including source control, <acronym title="Continuous Integration"><span class="caps">CI</span></acronym> and Build Server etc.)</li>	<li>The participants need to at least have a fair idea what they are doing</li>	<li>You need to have some sort of rough plan or schedule</li>	<li>You need food, drink, beer, alternative entertainment</li>	<li>You need a venue, a comfortable venue with internet access</li>	<li>Oh and I guess you need to invest in whiteboards.  Lots and lots of whiteboards, and markers, and cue cards and possibly deodorant.</li></ul><h2>People involved</h2><p>Agile makes sense here, of course it does.  So it&#8217;s not just a matter of locking a few devs away with coffee and vitamin pills.  No you need product owners at hand, you need someone testing and you need some sort of <span class="caps">BDFL</span> (Benevolent Dictator for Life).  I guess a <span class="caps">BDFL</span> isn&#8217;t mandatory but a technical lead who has the final say is certainly going to make the decision making process a lot quicker &#8211; be that good or bad.</p><p>Motivational people are another thing that would come in handy.  Having people see something and be like &#8220;yeah that&#8217;s nice, good job&#8221; is going to keep those flagging energy levels up.</p><p>Developer headcount is another balancing act.  You need enough people to make the goals achievable but you also can&#8217;t have too many people or you risk stamping on each others feet.  I guess it depends on the size/complexity of the idea you want to implement but a finger in the air guess I&#8217;d say between 4-8 developers with a product owner and a tester (could be the same person) would be a nice number.</p><h2>Development Approach</h2><p>I&#8217;ve already said agile seems like a perfect fit and I think the whole ecosystem that agile brings in fits well.  <acronym title="Test Driven Development"><span class="caps">TDD</span></acronym>/<acronym title="Behaviour Driven Design"><span class="caps">BDD</span></acronym> almost seems mandatory here &#8211; at least some level of it.  Checking in code with no tests around it is going to cause a headache when you hit a bug that takes and hour to track down.  A strict regime of constant branching, merging and checkins (every 20 minutes or less) along with a fast continuous build system will help discover problems <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p><h2>Atmosphere and Communication</h2><p>An entire project condensed into 24/48 hours is going to magnify the pain points and tensions will rise.  Techniques such as Pomodoro would come in handy to make sure people aren&#8217;t burning themselves out too fast.  A quiet room and alternative non-computer based entertainment will give people a quick escape on their pomodoro break and a chance to get their head showered.  Communication <span class="caps">NEEDS</span> to flow so regular standups (every 30 minutes to an hour) are essential to spot problems early and find a way to resolve them quickly.  Again having some sort <acronym title="Benevolent Dictator for Life"><span class="caps">BDFL</span></acronym> could really help in this situation.</p><h2>Where now?</h2><p>You know what &#8211; someway, somehow I am going to do this.  Consider it part of my career bucket list.  Something I want to do before I join the great geek scrapheap in the sky.  Could I get the people? Yeah I reckon I could.  Could I get the sponsorship/support?  Most likely.  Could I find a suitable idea to run with?  Hells yeah.  So what is stopping me?  Hmmmmmm nothing.  <span class="caps">BRB</span> got a hackathon to organise&#8230;&#8230;..<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not all managers are created equal but they have a job to do and process, meetings, documents etc. all get in the way.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yeah really.  No joke.  I can but try.</p></div>

So can we call sprocs using our microORMs, and if yes how?  Lets go see shall we?<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p><h2>Dapper</h2><p>Dapper makes use of an extra parameter in its <code>Query&lt;T&gt;</code> method to specify a specific command type.  In this way it&#8217;s simply a matter of passing in the name of the sproc, the parameters and a <code>CommandType.StoredProcedure</code> as a named parameter.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1032323.js?file=Dapper.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author author = conn.Query&lt;Author&gt;(    "GetAuthorById",    new { Id = 1 },    commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure).First();</code></pre></noscript></p><p>And boom thats it.  Same applies for multiple results.</p><h2>Massive</h2><p>Massive just works.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1032340.js?file=Massive.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>dynamic dyn = tbl.Query("GetAuthorById @0", 1).First();</code></pre></noscript></p><p>All I did was swap out the <span class="caps">SELECT</span> statement for the name of the sproc and Bobs Your Uncle.  Nice.</p><h2>PetaPoco</h2><p>PetaPoco has <em>some</em> support for sprocs.  For my needs in this article it works fine but apparently it doesn&#8217;t support output parameters <span class="caps">ATM</span>.  You need to prepend your call to the sproc with a DB specific command.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1032349.js?file=PetaPoco.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author a = db.Query&lt;Author&gt;("EXECUTE GetAuthorById @0", 1).First();</code></pre></noscript></p><p>The <code>EXECUTE</code> statement is database specific.  If you are using MySql you need to use <code>CALL</code> instead which kind of starts breaking the abstraction a bit.  I wonder if we will see this support getting more solidified in future releases.</p><h2>ServiceStack ORMLite</h2><p>At the time of writing this I couldn&#8217;t see any built in support for sprocs using ORMLite.  Either I am being my typical clueless self or we would just have to do it by hand.  Here is what I came up with,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1032433.js?file=ORMLite.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author author = dbFactory.Exec(dbCmd =&gt; {    dbCmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;    dbCmd.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@id", 1));    dbCmd.CommandText = "GetAuthorById";    return dbCmd.ExecuteReader().ConvertTo&lt;Author&gt;();});</code></pre></noscript></p><p>It&#8217;s not exactly the worst thing in the world and I guess you could wrap this stuff in an extension method but still I feel spoilt by the other microORMs so far and this was a slight disappointment.  Perhaps someone could either confirm or deny sproc support in ORMLite?</p><h2>Simple.Data</h2><p>Simple.Data has lovely syntax for this.  You just call it as yet another dynamic method on the database object and Simple.Data just infers it for you.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src='https://gist.github.com/1032360.js?file=SimpleData.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author author = Simple.Data.Database.Open().GetAuthorById(1).First();</code></pre></noscript></p><p>Yeah thats nice.</p><h2>Slightly Shorter and Summing Up</h2><p>So I didn&#8217;t want this one to have too much waffle (bar the odd text adventure here and there).  I was concerned that perhaps calling sprocs might be one of those requirements were the whole microORM stuff starts falling apart but no.  They actually handle the whole thing in a nice, clean manner.</p><p>Simple.Data is certainly starting to look more appealing to me and the whole fact that it&#8217;s not database specific (you&#8217;ve got NoSQL stores and even experimental things such as a Registry adapter &#8211; imagine this as part of Powershell).</p><p>Anyway some code snippets for this stuff are currently available in the <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/microorm-comparison">project/series github repo</a></p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not a real game.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>I&#8217;ve just pushed a new version of <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler">Baler</a>.  It&#8217;s current version of 0.3 but semantically speaking it should be v0.2.2 as I haven&#8217;t changed the <span class="caps">API</span>.  But hey we all make mistakes :(</p><h2>What&#8217;s New?</h2><p>Thanks to a suggestion from <a href="https://github.com/edazdarevic">edazdarevic</a> this release reworks the way files are generated.</p><p>Originally if a bale wasn&#8217;t flagged as generated (e.g. after an <span class="caps">IIS</span> reset) a new file with a random name would be generated.  This mean&#8217;t that during development a shed load of files would be generated as you changed some other file and restarted your server.  This lead to an awful mess in your output folder.  Now what happens if a bale isn&#8217;t flagged as generated the contents of the file are processed and a hash is generated from this.  This hash is then used as the filename for that file (appended with the correct extension).  If that file exists then the contents haven&#8217;t changed and are not written out to a new file saving that extra file system write.</p><p>In the future I&#8217;d like to adopt the approach of simply writing out references to the bales contents during <code>DEBUG</code>/development mode and only process the bales when in <code>PRODUCTION</code> mode.  But for now I think this is a reasonable stop gap.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/edazdarevic">edazdarevic</a> has some <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/baler/issues/1">more ideas</a> that I plan on trying to integrate but I need more time to think about how to approach it without bloating the code.</p></div>

Lets create a table of authors, lets call it <code>Authors</code><sup class="footnote" id="fnr0"><a href="#fn0">0</a></sup></p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028123.js?file=createauthors.sql'></script><noscript><pre><code>CREATE TABLE Authors(  Id          int          IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,  Username    varchar(50)                NOT NULL,  FullName    varchar(250)               NOT NULL,  CreatedDate datetime                   NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT PK_Authors PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (Id ASC))</code></pre></noscript><p>And populate it with some (meaningless) data<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028134.js?file=insertauthors.sql'></script><noscript><pre><code>INSERT INTO Authors(Username, FullName, CreatedDate) VALUES ('0@example.com', 'James Red', GETDATE());INSERT INTO Authors(Username, FullName, CreatedDate) VALUES ('1@example.com', 'Harry Black', GETDATE());-- ...CROPPED FOR BREVITY...INSERT INTO Authors(Username, FullName, CreatedDate) VALUES ('134@example.com', 'Chloe Green', GETDATE());</code></pre></noscript><p>Finally we need to create the equivalent C# object that our results can map to.  Again nothing too crazy here,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028148.js?file=Author.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class Author{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Username { get; set; }    public string FullName { get; set; }    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }}</code></pre></noscript><p>So now the stage is set and it&#8217;s time for our microORMs to play their part.</p><h2>Selecting Single and Multiple Authors</h2><p>So lets assume we want to do 2 things -</p><ul>	<li>Select a single author with an Id of 1, and,</li>	<li>Select multiple authors whose username (in this case the users email address) ends with <em>example.com</em>.</li></ul><h3>Dapper</h3><p>Dapper has a single way of querying your database and it offers this via an extension method on the standard <code>SqlConnection</code> class,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028156.js?file=DapperSelect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString)){    conn.Open();    Author a = conn.Query&lt;Author&gt;(        "SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Id = @Id",         new { Id = 1 }).First();}</code></pre></noscript><p>As you can see I&#8217;ve just opened a normal connection using a ConnectionString property I pulled from my <code>App.config</code>&#8217;s ConnectionString config block.  The magic here lies in the <code>Query&lt;Author&gt;</code> method.  This method accepts a parameterised <span class="caps">SQL</span> string and maps the result back into the object you specified.  Ultra simple, ultra clean.  There are a whole host of other arguments to the <code>Query&lt;T&gt;</code> method but it would fill this post up pretty fast.</p><p>Selecting multiple object simply requires me to change the query to meet the new requirements,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028838.js?file=DapperSelectMany.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;Author&gt; dapperA = conn.Query&lt;Author&gt;(    "SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Username LIKE @PartialUsername",    new { PartialUsername = "%example.com" });</code></pre></noscript><p>One of the features I really liked apart from the simplicity of the whole thing was the parameterised <span class="caps">SQL</span>.  Many of the frameworks support this but most support it by index based assignment e.g. &#8220;<span class="caps">WHERE</span> Id=@0&#8221;.  Thats fine but Dappers use of an anonymous object makes the whole thing that little bit nicer. No need to refactor strings should your arguments move around (it has happened) and it all reads just that tiny bit better as well.</p><p>Dapper also offers a non-generic <code>Query</code> method that returns instances of <code>dynamic</code> objects but I&#8217;m still to be convinced that this is useful when pushing these models into and back out of views etc.  Still it&#8217;s nice to have for those times that creating another model would be overkill.</p><h3>Massive</h3><p>Massive is slightly different to the other microORMs in that it only deals with <code>dynamic</code> objects from queries.  This means if you need concrete models you will have to map them either manually or use a tool to help (such as <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/">AutoMapper</a>).  Due to my schema (pluarl table names) I use Massive in a slightly different way to most people.  Massive requires your models to extend <code>Massive.DynamicModel</code> so to keep things clean I tended to naturally create a model that represents my Authors table,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1028975.js?file=MassiveAuthors.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public class Authors : Massive.DynamicModel{    public Authors()        : base("DefaultConnectionString")    {        PrimaryKeyField = "Id";    }}</code></pre></noscript><p>This provides an entry point for configuring how Massive connects to your database.  The <code>DynamicModel</code> has a constructor that allows us to specify a connection string name that Massive will lookup from the <code>Web/App.config</code> <code>ConnectionStrings</code> config section.  Alternatively if you don&#8217;t supply this Massive will grab the first one it finds.  This class also allows us to specify the table name (in this case inferred from the class name) and properties such as the primary key of the table (as shown above).</p><p>Now we have our class defined we can start selecting from the database.  To select a single object we can use the <code>Single</code> method.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029000.js?file=MassiveSelectOne.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Authors table = new Authors();dynamic result = table.Single(1);Author author = Authors.Map(result);</code></pre></noscript><p>You&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;ve made another step here and that is mapping the <code>dynamic</code> result to a concrete <code>Author</code> object.  It&#8217;s a simple mapping method added to the <code>Authors</code> object but could be made more generic fairly easiy,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029005.js?file=MassiveAuthorMap.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>public static Author Map(dynamic obj){    return new Author    {        Id = obj.Id,        CreatedDate = obj.CreatedDate,        FullName = obj.FullName,        Username = obj.Username    };}</code></pre></noscript><p>Selecting multiple objects can be done in 2 ways using <code>All</code> which returns the entire table and then you filter or using the <code>Query</code> method (preferred unless you really want to return the entire table for refdata or something I guess)</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029015.js?file=MassiveSelectMany.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>var tbl = new Authors();IList&lt;dynamic&gt; dyn = tbl.Query(    "SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Username LIKE @0",     "%example.com");</code></pre></noscript><div class="update"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> Rob, the creator of Massive, has just pushed <a href="http://wekeroad.com/post/6618062904/changed-my-mind-massive-changed-to-embrace-c">a new type of query syntax</a> into Massive.  The new approach makes use of named parameters</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1031800.js?file=MassiveExample.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>dynamic db = new Products();var products = db.FindBy(    CategoryID:8,    UnitPrice:100);</code></pre></noscript><p>I haven&#8217;t rewritten my stuff in this post but I want to close this post off and move on.  There is plenty more info in the <a href="http://wekeroad.com/post/6618062904/changed-my-mind-massive-changed-to-embrace-c">original post</a></p></div><h3>PetaPoco</h3><p>PetaPoco has a number of way of selecting single objects, or more specifically multiple ways of building/manipulating <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries.  But before we do that we need to get access to the database.  We do this via the <code>PetaPoco.Database</code> object which is an <code>IDisposable</code> wrapper around a Database connection that gives us the PetaPoco magic.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029030.js?file=PetaPocoDatabase.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>using (PetaPoco.Database db = new PetaPoco.Database("DefaultConnectionString")){    // query goes here}</code></pre></noscript><div class="update"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/toptensoftware">Brad Robinson</a> has informed me that the <code>using</code> statement is unnecessary</p><blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t need to explicitly dispose the database object unless you&#8217;ve called OpenSharedConnection yourself. The idea is that if you&#8217;re using an <span class="caps">IOC</span> container to instantiate per-http-context instances you can call OpenSharedConnection at the start of the request and a single connection will be used for the entire http request. In practice I&#8217;ve found this not really necessary as most providers do connection pooling anyway. In other words, generally the using clause is not necessary.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Database constructor takes a name of a defined connection string to use for connecting to the database.  Now we are ready to start writing our query,</p><p><strong>Using Single(id)</strong></p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029032.js?file=PetaPocoSelect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author a = db.Single&lt;Author&gt;(1);</code></pre></noscript><p><strong>Using Custom Parameterised <span class="caps">SQL</span></strong></p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029033.js?file=PetaPocoSelect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author b = db.Single&lt;Author&gt;("SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Id = @0", 1);</code></pre></noscript><div class="update"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/toptensoftware">Brad Robinson</a> pointed out that it is also possible to used named parameters as discussed in the Dapper section above <code>@MyNamedParam</code> instead of <code>@0</code>.  The niceness just keeps coming with PetaPoco</p></div><p><strong>Using <span class="caps">SQL</span> Builder to Append Statements</strong></p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029034.js?file=PetaPocoSelect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author c = db.Single&lt;Author&gt;(    PetaPoco.Sql.Builder        .Append("SELECT * FROM Authors")        .Append("WHERE Id = @0", 1));</code></pre></noscript><p><strong>Using <span class="caps">SQL</span> Builders Fluent Syntax to Append Statements</strong></p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029036.js?file=PetaPocoSelect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author d = db.Single&lt;Author&gt;(    PetaPoco.Sql.Builder        .Select("*")        .From("Authors")        .Where("Id = @0", 1));</code></pre></noscript><p>See what I mean?  Lots of ways.  Now I guess the 3rd and 4th methods will probably seem a bit <acronym title="Over The Top"><span class="caps">OTT</span></acronym> for this simple select but think how powerful these would be if we had to conditionally build up our where clause or select statement based on a number of user defined conditions.  Nice.</p><p>Selecting multiple objects offers the same sort of variety except we can use either <code>Query</code> or <code>Fetch</code>.  The difference between the two is summed up by the PetaPoco site,</p><blockquote><p>These are pretty much identical except <code>Fetch</code> returns a List&lt;&gt; of POCO&#8217;s whereas <code>Query</code> uses <code>yield return</code> to iterate over the results without loading the whole set into memory.</p></blockquote><p>So what I say about <code>Query</code> applies to <code>Fetch</code> as well.  Retrieving multiple objects is done in the same way as selecting a single object in that you can give the method parameterised <span class="caps">SQL</span> or use the <span class="caps">SQL</span> builder to construct the query.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029078.js?file=PetaPocoSelectMany.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;Author&gt; authors = db.Query&lt;Author&gt;(    "SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Username LIKE @0",     "%example.com");</code></pre></noscript><p>So to cover this off a full select using PetaPoco will would look like this.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029081.js?file=PetaPocoSelectFull.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>using (PetaPoco.Database db = new PetaPoco.Database("DefaultConnectionString")){    Author q = db.Single&lt;Author&gt;("SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Id = @0", 1);}</code></pre></noscript><p><span class="caps">IMO</span> The syntax is nice, clean and flexible.  One thing about PetaPoco that is a <span class="caps">VERY</span> minor pain point for me is that it assumes singular name for tables which contradicted my earlier decision.  Not to worry PetaPoco uses attributes against the model class to manipulate the standard configuration and I can specify a class level attribute of <code>[PetaPoco.TableName("Authors")]</code> to put things right with the world.  This also only applies to the queries that use object inference such as <code>Single&lt;T&gt;</code> and not to the methods that accept <span class="caps">SQL</span>.</p><h3>ServiceStack ORMLite</h3><p>ORMLite from ServiceStack does things a wee bit differently to the rest.  It&#8217;s a bit less self-contained because it also applies extension methods to the string object as well.  Also like PetaPoco it takes the singular naming convention for Object Name &rarr; Table Name so first things first we need to annotate our <code>Author</code> model with another attribtue</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029204.js?file=ServiceStackAtribute.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>[ServiceStack.DataAnnotations.Alias("Authors")]</code></pre></noscript><p>Another thing we need to do once before hand is set the dialect the ORMLite will use.  This is so it knows how to speak to the specific database type we created.  Typically you would put this in something like <code>Global.asax.cs</code>, <code>Program.cs</code> or whatever bootstrapper you care to use as it needs done only once.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029116.js?file=Dialect.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>OrmLiteConfig.DialectProvider = new SqlServerOrmLiteDialectProvider();</code></pre></noscript><p>Now we can go ahead and start selecting things like a boss,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029120.js?file=ORMLiteSelectSingle.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>using (IDbConnection db = "...".OpenDbConnection())using (IDbCommand cmd = db.CreateCommand()){    Author rows = cmd.GetById&lt;Author&gt;(1);}</code></pre></noscript><p>And for selecting many</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029129.js?file=ORMLiteSelectMany.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>using (IDbConnection db = Program.ConnectionString.OpenDbConnection())using (IDbCommand cmd = db.CreateCommand()){    List&lt;Author&gt; rows = cmd.Select&lt;Author&gt;(        "Username LIKE {0}",         "%example.com");}</code></pre></noscript><p>Alternatively if we want to perform a specific operation on each result we can use the <code>Each&lt;T&gt;</code> to iterate over the result set rather than simply return it.</p><p>As you can see you don&#8217;t need to specify a full <span class="caps">SQL</span> query, just the <span class="caps">WHERE</span> clause which makes everything look a little bit neater and avoids repeating unnecessary portions of <span class="caps">SQL</span> that could be inferred.</p><p>ORMLite&#8217;s syntax is <em>slighlty</em> more complex &#8211; it feels a bit closer to the metal.  But it&#8217;s certainly not horribly different that it would put me off using it.</p><div class="update"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> It seems there is another way to query the database that makes things a bit shorter.  Thanks to mythz (in the comments) for this one.</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1030717.js?file=Alternative.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>IDbConnectionFactory dbFactory = new OrmLiteConnectionFactory("...", 	SqlServerOrmLiteDialectProvider.Instance);Author author = dbFactory.Exec(dbCmd =&gt; dbCmd.GetById&lt;Author&gt;(1));List&lt;Author&gt; rows = dbFactory.Exec(dbCmd =&gt; 	dbCmd.Select&lt;Author&gt;("Username LIKE {0}", "%example.com"));</code></pre></noscript><p>I agree that this is a viable alternative and can make for shorter code.  Thanks.</p></div><h3>Simple.Data</h3><p>Finally Simple.Data offers a very clean syntax that mixes dynamic with concrete results.  The first thing you need to do with Simple.Data is get a handle on the Database object that is returned as a special <code>dynamic</code> object.  There are a number of ways of doing this,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029142.js?file=SimpleData.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Simple.Data.Database.Open();Simple.Data.Database.OpenNamedConnection("DefaultConnectionString");Simple.Data.Database.OpenConnection(Program.ConnectionString);</code></pre></noscript><p>By using <code>Database.Open()</code> Simple.Data will look for a connection string called <code>Simple.Data.Properties.Settings.DefaultConnectionString</code> and use it to create the database instance.  Alternatively you can specify a specific named connection using <code>Database.OpenNamedConnection</code> or even a raw connection string using <code>Database.OpenConnection</code></p><p>These methods all return a special <code>dynamic</code> object that dynamically creates a <span class="caps">SQL</span> statement by constructing methods on the fly.  It&#8217;s best to look at the code for this.  To select a single object we can do this,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029154.js?file=SimpleDataFind.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>Author author = Simple.Data.Database.Open().Author.FindById(1);</code></pre></noscript><p>So whats happening here.  Well firstly we a asking it to look at the Authors table.  Next we are telling it to FindById &#8211; but this method doesn&#8217;t exist. We could easily have said FindByUsernameAndEmail and we would get the results we expected.  This bit of metaprogramming is the magic behind Simple.Data where method signatures are parsed and used to build <span class="caps">SQL</span>.  Nice stuff.  I still have a bit of issue working with dynamic objects but in this case my models are concrete so it&#8217;s really not an issue.</p><p>Selecting multiple objects is that same except instead of <code>FindByXXX</code> we use <code>FindAllByXXX</code> and as this query returns a <code>SimpleQuery</code> object we then need to perform a <code>.Cast&lt;Author&gt;</code> at the end to get back a list of authors.</p><p>An alternative and more flexible way of doing queries is using <code>Find</code> and <code>FindAll</code>.  These methods let you specify more complex queries.  To implement our <code>LIKE</code> comparison for our query above we need to use <code>FindAll</code> like so,</p><script src='https://gist.github.com/1029181.js?file=SimpleDataSelectMany.cs'></script><noscript><pre><code>dynamic authors = Simple.Data.Database.Open().Authors;IEnumerable&lt;Author&gt; authors = authors    .FindAll(authors.Username.Like("%.com"))    .Cast&lt;Author&gt;();</code></pre></noscript><p>This also shows the use of the <code>Cast&lt;T&gt;</code> mentioned above.  We can supply a variable number of arguments to <code>Find</code> and <code>FindAll</code> as well as using different comparison operators.</p><h2>That Was a Long One<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></h2><p>So yeah not only have I touched on selecting single and multiple object at a high level I also had to add a bit of discussion around setting things up so I apologise for the length of this post.  On the plus side discussing configuration alone for MyBatis and nHibernate would probably take the same length of time.  Thats whats great about these microORMs 99% of the time you don&#8217;t need all that set up for most projects.  No need getting bogged down in configuration when it&#8217;s not actually achieving anything.</p><p>In terms of the syntax &#8211; so far I am quite taken by both Simple.Data and PetaPoco but that could change when I start really pushing things &#8211; after all everyone can do selects quite easily.</p><p>In terms of dynamic results (e.g. from Massive) I&#8217;m still to be convinced on their usefulness without having to always map to concrete classes.  I don&#8217;t see how this helps refactoring (it looks like it makes it much worse) nor do I see how it works with most validation mechanisms.  But I would love to be proven wrong on this please.</p><p>One thing I do know &#8211; it&#8217;s going to take a lot more justification for someone to use a heavyweight <span class="caps">ORM</span> in my next project.  While I not willing to declare the death of ORMs like some other people I am certainly leaning in that direction.</p><p>Source for this series is slowly evolving in a <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/microorm-comparison">Github repo</a> if you feel inspired to have a poke around.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn0"><a href="#fnr0"><sup>0</sup></a> We can argue about plural or singular data naming conventions some other time, or in the comments!!!</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> I created a load of test data using the handy little tool <a href="http://autopoco.codeplex.com/">AutoPoco</a></p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> &#8220;Thats what she said&#8221; &lt;self:facepalm&gt;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <blockquote class="announce">This post is the is part of series of posts covering the various microORMs in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.

While I have yet to use any in a real project I wanted to do a bit of comparison series.  It&#8217;s a bit selfish I guess as I am actually writing this series as a means to get myself up to speed on these frameworks as well as inform others about perils I faced as a newcomer to them as and when I hit those pain points.</p><p>To be honest I&#8217;ve never been a fan of the Data Access layer in projects &#8211; Databases are fine I guess and the application layer is all good but that thin layer between the two just frustrates me.  It&#8217;s often needlessly over complicated, confusing, hacked together or just plain broken.  Most of my experience is with <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/dotnet.html">iBatis/MyBatis</a> and it &#8220;does the job&#8221; but its very fiddly and <span class="caps">XML</span> configuration becomes cumbersome for simple tasks.  I&#8217;ve also tinkered with other things like Entity Framework and NHibernate but more often than not they just don&#8217;t feel right.</p><p>This make microORMs sound appealing to me for the very same reasons.  They give you just enough to get the job done, prefer convention over configuration and generally allow you to get right down to the metal and tweak things using <span class="caps">SQL</span> &#8211; easily the best <span class="caps">DSL</span> for working with databases.  Sure they may lack many features but typically these are features you wouldn&#8217;t really miss if taken away from you.</p><h2>The MicroORMs</h2><p>There are a number of ORMs currently available for .<span class="caps">NET</span> and I am going to look at a few of them in terms of features and syntax.<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p><h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/">Dapper</a></h3><p>Dapper was created by Sam Saffron from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>. Rather than a library Dapper is a single file that you can drop into your project and applies some syntactic sugar to extend your IDbConnection interface.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a></h3><p>Like Dapper, Massive is a single file rather than a library and offers a very similar feature set to Dapper except it works exclusively with the .NET4 <code>dynamic</code> stuff.</p><h3><a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/">PetaPoco</a></h3><p>PetaPoco came out of inspiration from Massive and has extended to support real objects as well as some very nice extra features such as T4 templating, configuration via model attributes and other nice stuff.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data">Simple.Data</a></h3><p>Simple.Data is A lightweight, dynamic data access component that make use of convention and <code>dynamic</code> to allow users to access database tables via dynamically generated methods.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">ORMLite</a></h3><p>ServiceStack.OrmLite is a convention-based, configuration-free lightweight <span class="caps">ORM</span> that uses standard <span class="caps">POCO</span> classes and Data Annotation attributes to infer its table schema.</p><h2>On with the show</h2><p>So thats my toys all laid out and ready to be played with.  Next step is to look at some of the typical operations for selecting and manipulating data from our database.  I hope to have the first real part of this investigation up shortly (or before the decade is out at least).</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> This list is not exhaustive there are a few specialised ones around as well which I may touch on later in the series.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <h1>Baler</h1><p>I have just released a new version of <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler">Baler</a>.  Version 0.2.1 release adds a new feature for adding custom attributes to bales.  The <code>Attr</code> function, available as an instance method to all bales, accepts an attribute name and a string value that will be applied to the rendered bale tag.  The best way to demonstrate this is with an example.</p><h2><span class="caps">CSS</span> Media Attribute</h2><p>When specifying link tags for <span class="caps">CSS</span> it is possible to scope that stylesheet to a specific meida type.  For example you could have a stylesheet that modifies your page style for printing e.g.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016555.js?file=style.css"></script></p><p>The new <code>Attr</code> method allows you to specify this new attribute like so,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016560.js?file=Baler.cs"></script></p><h2>&#8220;No Value&#8221; Attributes</h2><p>Some attributes, such as the <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code> on script tags do not require a value.  <code>Attr</code> is capable of dealing with these type of attributes.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016564.js?file=async.js"></script></p><p>Will produce</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016565.js?file=script.html"></script></p><p>I am sure there are other uses for it (setting id&#8217;s or data-* attributes) as it&#8217;s a fairly flexible little enhancement.</p><h1><span class="caps">CSS</span> Media Extensions</h1><pre><code>PM&gt; Install-Package CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.CssMedia</code></pre><p>The first extension to utilise this new <code>Attr</code> is the <code>CssMediaExtensions</code> addon. <code>CssMediaExtensions</code> provide methods for setting the media type that a stylesheet should render for such as screen or print</p><h2>WithMedia()</h2><p>The WithMedia Extension allows you to set the media attribute of the rendered <span class="caps">CSS</span> tag.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016677.js?file=withmedia.cs"></script></p><h2>AsCss()</h2><p><code>AsCss</code> overrides the existing <code>AsCss</code> method allowing you to pass a media attribute value directly into the render call. For example the above example could simply be written as,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016682.js?file=ascss.cs"></script></p><h1>Named Bales Extension</h1><pre><code>PM&gt; Install-Package CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.NamedBales</code></pre><p>This one has been released for a while but I didn&#8217;t get around to writing about it. TheNamed Bales extension provides a mechanism to declare a Bale definition up front and reuse the same bale throughout the application without having to redefine the contents over and over. For example we can define a bale with 3 scripts and name it</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016778.js?file=namedbale.cs"></script></p><p>This can returns the Bale itself so can be used inline or somewhere like <code>Global.asax</code>. Next we can render this bundle using <code>AsJs</code> later in the app like so,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1016781.js?file=bale.cs"></script></p><p>Currently this doesn?t short circuit Balers internal cache so a second cache check will be made using the internal hashing mechanism. This is either a good thing or a bad thing. But for now it?s a good thing! This does have the side effect of ensuring that any unnamed bales with the same signature as a named bale will still get cached bale.</p><h3>NameAs()</h3><p>NameAs adds some sugar to the IBale interface allowing us to apply a friendly name to a bale. There is currently no check to see if the bale name is already taken. Existing definitions will be overwritten.</p><h3>NamedBales.Get()</h3><p>Allows us to retrieve a bale based on a friendly name defined by the developer. Will throw and exception if the bale name doesn?t exist in the cache ? otherwise the bale itself.</p><h1>Coming Up</h1><p>Still plenty to be done.  Docs are fairly complete but there are a mountain of unit tests to be written still and some extra features to be added (without bloating the code base of course).  I have a few features I&#8217;d like to work in but I&#8217;ll keep that for another day.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>It&#8217;s very early days (with regards to both code and documentation) but I though I amy as well put it out there.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> is a .<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Resource Bundler. Capable of concatenating and transforming <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files to lower request count and bandwidth requirements. It works with any .<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Framework/View Engine capable of running C# in the view</p></blockquote><p>What differentiates <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> from other resource bundlers out there is that it aims to provided a bare bones, minimum feature set for building bales (or resource bundle).  The core <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler">Baler package</a> offers the ability to concatenate, render and cache JavaScript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> bales.  Thats it.  No minification nor fancy processing nothing.  However <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> does have 2 main extensibility hooks though (<code>Before</code> and <code>After</code>) which can be leveraged to control how bundles are manipulated.  There are currently 3 extensions for Baler but more are on their way,</p><ol>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a> &#8211; Transforms <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> files into JavaScript</li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.Less">.<span class="caps">LESS</span></a> &#8211; Transforms <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.org/">.<span class="caps">LESS</span></a> files into <span class="caps">CSS</span></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.AjaxMinifier">Ajax Minifier</a> &#8211; Allows for minification of JavaScript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> using Microsofts Ajax Minifier</li></ol><h2>Quick Example</h2><script src="https://gist.github.com/998778.js?file=BalerExample.aspx"></script><p>This example will take 3 source files concatenate them into a random script file and output the necessary <code>&lt;script src='1jdk2ds.js' type='text/javascript'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.  Subsequent calls that match this bales signature (the order and contents of the bale) will use the cached script tag and not perform that concatenation again.</p><p>As I say it&#8217;s early days.  I really need to get the docs up to snuff, write plenty of test and add a few more features before I start shouting from the rooftops but at least it&#8217;s out now and there is no going back :-).</p><p>Baler v0.1 is available on <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler">Nuget</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/baler.git">Github</a> and the annotated source code is available <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/Baler.html" title="Core">here</a>, <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.AjaxMinifier/MinificationExtensions.html" title="AjaxMin Extensions">here</a>, <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.CoffeeScript/CoffeeScriptExtensions.html" title="CoffeeScript Extensions">here</a> and <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.Less/LessExtensions.html" title=".LESS Extensions">here</a></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>Soooooo anyway I had the day off today and you know what they say &#8211; the devil makes work for idle hands.  And boy did that devil dude really go to town on me.  Earlier this morning I came across a tweet.  The sort of tweet that I like.  A highly polarising tweet that makes geeks stand up and cheer and makes everyone else feel like we are laughing at them.  Anyway heres the tweet,</p><blockquote><p><cite>&#8220;pragmaticpat: adults are &#8220;pro homework&#8221; for children, yet frequently do not study their craft outside of m-f, 9-5 #leadbyexample ?&quot;</cite></p></blockquote><p>So anyway I thought, as I was waiting in the car for the wife to finishing shopping or whatever she was doing at the time, I would throw this tweet up to our <a href="http://yammer.com">Yammer</a> community and stir up a bit of debate.  Things got a bit heated, more than even I would have liked.  In fact I think I offended people<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Lets say just I am beyond passionate about my job almost obsessively so in some respects.  Being that type of person I often expect everyone else to be just like me and therefore measure people against what I do.  I also tend to make statements as if there were 2 types of people in the world.  People like me, who go home and do a bit of extra work/research and people who do their 9-5 allocated work and don&#8217;t care about anything.  But hey there&#8217;s a twist here &#8211; I&#8217;m not actually stupid &#8211; I know the world isn&#8217;t black and white, us and them, all or nothing.  I&#8217;m also not as horribly snobby or elitist as I make out (I am a bit but thats just the nature of a technology fanboy &#8211; defensive about their passions &#8211; suck it).</p><p>Anyways enough of the woe is me schtick, it&#8217;s boring.  I just want to say that I understand there are people out there who do their 9-5 and go home and actually have a life beyond the keyboard.  I was never implying people need to work 24/7 or they are coasting.  I realise I have a bit of a reputation of being an elitist uber-geek and therefore many people may have assumed that was what I was getting at.  However I know that in the 9-5 block a lot of people are contributing more that just their time to a single project and are going out of their way to do something decent rather than mediocre.  I&#8217;m happy for someone to say <cite>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with were I am&#8221;</cite> &#8211; hell I am sure they&#8217;ve worked hard to get were they are so why not?  What I&#8217;m not happy with is someone who <strong>expect</strong> the same kudos as people who go above and beyond just because they show their face everyday.  When I retweeted that tweet and even went as far as yamming it I was stating an opinion, an opinion that wasn&#8217;t directed at any particular people or any particular company for that matter, it was just a blanket statement.</p><p>On a similar note I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of seeing plenty of CV&#8217;s over the last few years as well as interviewing people and I must say the industry has it&#8217;s fair share of people who are guru&#8217;s on paper but ask them a question about something that they haven&#8217;t encountered due to work on a project and they are flummoxed.  It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs to get into that shape.  It&#8217;s a bit like a morbidly obese fitness instructor &#8211; they can do their job but neglected to look after themselves &#8211; who would want to hire that sort of person?  Not many people I&#8217;d bet.</p><p>So yeah I accept that there are many different types of people.  People who want to better the industry as well as themselves.  People who want to better themselves and the company they work for.  People who just want to better themselves.  People who just want to do a super job with the role they are given and finally people who just want to get by<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. But I refuse to accept that everyone should be treated equally in all respects and as long as people can respect that then we can all get along.</p><p>So whats the point of all this?  I know I have high standards but I also need to learn that not everyone wants the same thing out of life.  Or more to the point that other people actually <span class="caps">HAVE</span> a life outside of IT.  In the past I&#8217;ve had shed loads of opportunity to shine, but I&#8217;ve also been on some long boring pressured projects so I need to realise other people are going through that too.  I need to be a bit smarter about this.  It&#8217;s even part of my job description to mentor others so I suck at my job (hence the title).  Perhaps I should pull my finger out and ensure people are given opportunities to shine?  Yeah thats sounds about right&#8230;.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> For what it&#8217;s worth I wasn&#8217;t asked, request or ordered to write this.  As always I am doing this for my own reasons.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> I&#8217;m sure you could break it down more.</p></div>
