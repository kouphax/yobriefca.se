  <div class="entry-content">  <blockquote class="announce">This post is the is part of series of posts covering the various <em>micro web frameworks</em> in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.  The frameworks I intend to cover will be linked as the series progresses.  For further discussion on the use of micro web framework in .<span class="caps">NET</span> please see my <a href="/blog/2011/05/18/why-use-micro-web-frameworks-in-net/">previous post</a> The current series line up:<ul>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/19/micro-web-frameworks-101-jessica/">Jessica</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/23/micro-web-frameworks-101-nancy/">Nancy</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/06/22/micro-web-frameworks-101-anna/">Anna</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/07/18/micro-web-frameworks-101-tinyweb//">Tinyweb</a><br></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="htttp://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> is a different beast to <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> while on the surface it may appear like a micro web framework, once you scratch the surface it becomes debatable because there is just some much more than a nice <span class="caps">DSL</span> for creating lightweight web apps.  In fact this was <a href="http://tombell.org.uk/blog/2011/04/10/why-did-i-create-jessica/">one of the reasons</a> Jessica was created,</p><blockquote><p>Nancy has taken an approach to making many parts of the framework replaceable; if you don?t like the functionality of X you can create your own, and have Nancy use that instead. While this is a respectable goal for a web framework, the focus for Jessica has been to stay as simple and as close to Sinatra as possible. <em>Tom Bell.  Why Did I Create Jessica?</em></p></blockquote><p>Anyway we will touch on these aspects a bit later.  Lets get cracking.</p><h2>Getting Started &#8211; Hello World</h2><p>Getting <a href="htttp://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> up and running is simple enough.  Starting with an empty <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> web project<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> we can use <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> to install Nancy</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985446.js?file=InstallPackage.cs"></script></p><p>Also because we are hosting this in an <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> environment (more on this later) we need to install the appropriate hosting package</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985450.js?file=InstallPackage.ps"></script></p><p>Next step requires us to add some stuff to the <code>web.config</code>.  If you&#8217;ve been smart and installed the hosting package from NuGet this steps is done for you but ultimately your minimal <code>web.config</code> should look like this.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985454.js?file=Web.config.xml"></script><p>The final step is to create the hello world module that will handle your route.  Again, like Jessica, it doesn&#8217;t matter where the module classes are placed but for neatness I just like to stick them in a <code>Modules</code> folder.  Our module will look very similar to the one we defined for Jessica.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985460.js?file=HelloWorldModule.cs"></script><p>And we&#8217;re done.  Fire the app up and behold the &#8220;Hello World&#8221;-yness of it all.</p><h2>Other Micro Framework Related Stuff</h2><p><a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> has some features that aren&#8217;t technically related to the micro framework aspect  &#8211; specifically hosting but I&#8217;ll touch on that later.  <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> also has a lot of nice features that are related to the micro framework aspects so lets take a bit of a whirlwind tour around the main areas first.</p><h3>Routes</h3><p>Routes in <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> are pretty powerful.  Obviously you get the declare static routes (as demonstrated above) but dynamic routes (routes with variables for example) are also supported in a few of ways.  First of all you have named segments.  These can be expressed in 2 ways</p><ol>	<li>Sinatra style variables <code>/user/:id</code>, or,</li>	<li>C#-esque <code>String.format</code> style <code>/user/{id}</code></li></ol><p>Declaring a route like this will cause the variable section to be pushed into a named variable within the dynamic object passedin into the route action. <code>/user/jameshu</code> matches <code>/user/:id</code> and the dynamic object passed into the action will have <code>x.id == "jameshu"</code></p><p>The other means of dynamic route matching is the use of regular expressions and named capture groups (or backreferences as they are sometimes known).  Using regular expressions as route parameters allows us to offer more fine grained route matching.  Take the following route as an example,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985797.js?file=Route.cs"></script></p><p>This route will <span class="caps">ONLY</span> match routes whose variable section matches the expression, in this case a numeric value.  So not only have we specified a route variable but we are also limiting access to that action to &#8220;valid&#8221; values.  This means we could also offer another route that accepts only alphabetical characters.  Powerful enough.</p><h3>Route Conditions</h3><p>Taking routes another step further <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> also offers optional conditions that can be used to determine if a route should be executed for a given request.  Lets use this heavily contrived example to demonstrate this feature,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985818.js?file=SecretRoute.cs"></script></p><p>So this route will match any route starting with <code>/user</code> however the condition (the second argument of the definition) will ensure that the route action will only get executed if the query string is populated with an argument called password with a value of secrets i.e <code>http://myserver/user?password=secrets</code> will match successfully.</p><h3>Views</h3><p><a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> supports a decent range of view engines<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p><ul>	<li>Razor</li>	<li>Spark</li>	<li>NDjango and, obviously,</li>	<li>Static files</li></ul><p>Serving up dynamic vies is fairly simple</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985832.js?file=ModuleWithView.cs"></script><p>We basically use the View object to specify the view and optionally pass in a view model as well.  By default Nancy will look in the <code>~/Views</code> folder for the views but you can also specify a full path if needs be.  The view is then matched against the available view engines and rendered as you would expect.  This is the Razor view specified above.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985835.js?file=View.cshtml"></script><h3>Responses</h3><p>Nancy is also capable of returning static content as different responses (similar to how Jessica does it).  Each route action is expected to return a Nancy Response object. The object itself has a number of convenience methods for serving static files and <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></acronym> such as <code>Response.AsJs</code>, <code>Response.AsJson</code>, <code>Response.AsXml</code>, , <code>Response.AsRedirect</code> etc.</p><h2>Hosting</h2><p>This is were things move away from &#8220;micro framework&#8221; world a bit.  Nancy itself abstracts out the hosting environment making the entire framework portable allowing you to host in any number of places including (but not limited to),</p><ul>	<li>Self hosted (e.g. embedded within an executable)</li>	<li><span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span>/<span class="caps">IIS</span> (as demonstrated above)</li>	<li><span class="caps">WCF</span> (yep thats right), and,</li>	<li>Some partial <a href="http://bvanderveen.com/a/dotnet-http-abstractions"><span class="caps">OWIN</span></a> support</li></ul><p>This, to me at least, is very interesting.  Being able to build an executable that accepts <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests could be pretty powerful in the right hands and the <span class="caps">WCF</span> stuff sounds very interesting (is this similar to what the new <span class="caps">WCF</span> Web <span class="caps">API</span> is attempting to offer?).  I need to play some more in this area.  I&#8217;ll report back when I am done.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>So that was a quick round up of the key features of Nancy and I think it&#8217;s another one worth looking at.  So hopefully you can also see how it differs from Jessica.  From a code perspective they seem quite similar (though Nancy has possibly a few more features) but the whole hosting abstraction layer is very interesting.  I have had people ask me if this introduced any new (or even old) security concerns and to be honest I don&#8217;t know but it might certainly be worth looking out for.</p><p>As always I may need corrections so please fire away.  Hopefully I can cover off these points with a few more screencasts over the next week.  Stay tuned.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> In my <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> I laid out steps to strip the normal <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Project template out of all the unnecessary bits.  Lord knows why I didn&#8217;t just create an empty web project &lt;facepalm/&gt;</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> Apparently it also has a built in view engine called the Super Simple View Engine but as of yet I can&#8217;t seem to get it to work.</p></div>

First on the table is <a href=":http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a>.</p><h2>Getting Started &#8211; Hello World</h2><p>Getting a simple Hello World set up in <a href=":http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> involves (optionally) taking more out than you put in.  <a href=":http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> requires very little configuration so creating a new web project, deleting all the extra files and folders, trimming the <code>web.config</code> and emptying the <code>Global.asax.cs</code> makes for a nice blank canvas to start with.</p><p class="img-holder"><img src="/media/images/blog/project-before-and-after.png" alt=""></p><p>Next step is pretty difficult :-).  Within the <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> Package Manager Console just install the Jessica package</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/979313.js?file=InstallJessica.ps"></script></p><p>Once installed be need to tell Jess to initialise/bootstrap itself when the application starts by calling the initialise method in the <code>Application_Start</code> method of the <code>Global.asax.cs</code></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/979324.js?file=Global.asax.cs"></script><p>At this point it&#8217;s also possible to supply a number of configuration options but we will touch on this later along with the optional configuration <span class="caps">XML</span>.  Now that Jess is setup to configure itself all we need to do now is define the module that will handle our complex Hello World output.</p><p>Modules form the basis of Jessica each one holding a number of routes (based on URL&#8217;s and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> verbs) and associated actions.  Our app will have a single module,</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/979345.js?file=MainModule.cs"></script><p>This simple module defines a single route that will match any standard <code>GET</code> request for the root of the app. And that&#8217;s it.  When you run the app Jess will inspect the assembly and find all the modules and wire up the routes.</p><h2>The Rest of the Pie</h2><p>Obviously serving plain bits of text is a bit useless so there are plenty of things that Jessica offers that makes it, well, actually useful.</p><h3>Configuration</h3><p>Jessica can be configured programatically or via <span class="caps">XML</span> config.  A number of things you can currently set include,</p><ul>	<li>Environment &#8211; the environment you build in e.g. <code>development</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>release</code>.  Default <code>development</code></li>	<li>Public Directory &#8211; The directory to be used to server static content (html, js, css, images) that require no preprocessing. Default <code>public</code></li>	<li>Views Directory &#8211; The directory to be used to serve views that can be dynamically rendered (Razor, Textile, Markdown, Liquid etc.).  Default <code>views</code></li></ul><p>The <span class="caps">XML</span> config is outlined below but each of these properties can be set in the <code>Global.asax.cs</code> programatically as well via the <code>Jess.Configuration</code> properties.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/979475.js?file=Web.config.xml"></script><h3>Routes and Actions</h3><p>Routes may be defined as a literal path such as <code>/users</code> or <code>/store/toys</code> or with variable segments such as <code>/user/:id</code> or <code>/blog/:year/:month/:day</code>.  Variable segments are then parsed out of the route url and the values added to the action argument.</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/980298.js?file=Routes.cs"></script></p><p>That seems to be about the extent of the route manipulation for now.  Would be nice to see the other Sinatra stuff included such as <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Routes">splats</a>, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Routes">regular expressions</a> and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Conditions">conditions</a>.</p><p>Actions are fairly simple they take a dynamic object and are expected to return a Jessica <code>Response</code> object.  The dynamic object passed in contains a number of things such as route parameters, querystring parameters and the current HttpContext.  As an added niceness the Jessica <code>Response</code> object has a number of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z5z9kes2(v=vs.71).aspx">implicit</a> type conversions that allow us to return simpler objects</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/980308.js?file=ImplicitTypes.cs"></script><h3>Static Content</h3><p>Jessica allows us to return static content simply.  First of all all routes are first checked for the existence of a file at that <span class="caps">URL</span>.  If a file is found it is served, if not then Jessica goes to the route table and works it&#8217;s magic.  Putting resources in the <code>publicDir</code> allows Jessica to serve static content from the route actions and the <code>Response</code> object comes with a number of nice helpers to help make your static actions neater.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/980313.js?file=JessicaResponse.cs"></script><h3>Views</h3><p>What web technology would be complete without the ability to serve non-static views?  Oddly enough Jessica, out of the box at least, comes with no view engines.  I suspect this is because dynamic view rendering isn&#8217;t technically something that should form the basis of a web framework &#8211; thats the job of the view engines.  Jessica does however come with an extension point of adding X amount of view engines &#8211; <code>Jess.ViewEngines</code>.  There is also a healthy volume of view engines available for Jessica,</p><ul>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Jessica-ViewEngine-Razor">Razor</a></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Jessica-ViewEngine-Spark">Spark</a></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Jessica-ViewEngine-DotLiquid">DotLiquid</a></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Jessica-ViewEngine-Markdown">Markdown</a></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Jessica-ViewEngine-Textile">Textile</a></li></ul><p>Rendering a view from an action is also very simple</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/980288.js?file=ViewJessica.cs"></script><p>The first option renders a simple view called index while the second takes a model object that is pushed into the scope of the view and can be used to build the view.  Jessica will loop through it&#8217;s <code>ViewEngines</code> collection and attempt to resolve the view name to a file in the specified <code>viewsDir</code> folder.  If it finds a matching view it will render it.</p><p>I am going to take the lead from Jessica itself and not dive into the various view choices for now.  They are pretty self explanatory anyway.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>So thats the 101, the skinny, the lowdown, the starter for 10, the basics and other random statements of <a href=":http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a>. Hopefully this covers the vast majority of what v0.83 of Jessica offers.  It&#8217;s a nice minimla framework that attempts to stick to Sinatra&#8217;s philosophy.  It would be nice to see a few more of Sinatras features creeping in especially route <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Conditions">conditions</a>.  There is also some nice high level error handling being introduced (for v0.9 I assume) for handling application wide errors and 404&#8217;s.  I plan on talking about these when they make an appearance.</p><p>Corrections, comments and criticisms below please.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <blockquote><p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Oh dear James &lt;shakeshead/&gt;.  So it seems someone was paying attention to my post and noticed my benchmarks were <strong>hideously</strong> flawed.  I have removed them because I don&#8217;t like looking like a total fool but I will be replacing the with <strong>honest, real and unstupified</strong> results as soon as I can.  Apologies for any distress this may have caused.  <acronym title="Fear Uncertainty Doubt"><span class="caps">FUD</span></acronym> is a powerful thing in the wrong hands but ignorance is worse.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of research into micro web frameworks in the.<span class="caps">NET</span> world recently and I was posed a question by a colleague.</p><blockquote><p>Whats the point of a micro web framework?</p></blockquote><p>I gave the usual response &#8211; more lightweight, smaller foot print blah blah blah. To be honest I was barely convincing myself.  I suspected I had fallen into the trap of latching on to something because it was novel to me rather than any real reason.  I am not saying they don&#8217;t have a place in solutions technology stack, quite the opposite in fact, what I am saying is that I didn&#8217;t have sufficient justification for bothering with them.</p><p>So I&#8217;ve spent a bit more time looking at the background of these microframeworks rather than the techs themselves and hopefully the next time someone asks I can give a more convincing reply.</p><h2>What Is A Micro Web Framework</h2><p>Pretty much a micro web framework is a framework that provides the absolute minimum feature set required to create a web application.  Extra features can be added via extensions etc. but the sole purpose of a microframework is to allow the app to handle requests to certain URLs (routing) with a bit of basic error handling for 404&#8217;s etc. (possibly).  No feature creep, no bloated deployments just ultra-lean request/response handling.</p><p>The most famous microframework, and the one that started it all, comes from the Ruby world &#8211; <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and it&#8217;s &#8220;Hello World&#8221; example really highlights the ease of creating an app.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/976291.js?file=Sinatra.rb"></script><p>Run this and navigate to <code>/hi</code> to see the amazing response of <code>Hello World</code>.</p><h2>Micro Web Frameworks in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> World</h2><p>So how does this compare to similar technologies in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.  Most .<span class="caps">NET</span> solutions take a lot of inspiration from <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> (and why not it&#8217;s pretty much the blueprints for the microframeworks) and this one is written using <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a>.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/976293.js?file=JessicaModule.cs"></script><p>OK so there is a bit of extra language noise but this is to be expected when moving from Ruby to C# but it&#8217;s just as readable.  <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> isn&#8217;t the only microframework in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world but it does seem to be one of the better ones (based on a very superficial amount of research &#8211; no offence meant to other frameworks &#8211; happy to be proven wrong).  The other frameworks considered &#8220;micro&#8221; include,</p><ul>	<li><a href="http://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy">Nancy</a></li>	<li><a href="http://github.com/martinrue/Tinyweb">Tinyweb</a></li>	<li><a href="http://github.com/jondot/nina">Nina</a></li>	<li><a href="http://github.com/carlhoerberg/NSinatra">NSinatra</a></li></ul><h2>What Makes Micro Frameworks Worthwhile?</h2><p>So lets expand on my original argument of <cite>&#8220;more lightweight, smaller foot print blah blah blah&#8221;</cite>.  The most obvious is that a microframework by design is going to be a lot more lightweight than a normal framework.  It&#8217;s lifecycle for a request is going to be greatly simplified and ultimately this should help increase performance per request (I currently have no figures to back this up yet but I am working on it).  As well as performance and increased throughput this lightweight approach should greatly reduce the memory footprint which will help your app scale a bit better<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Another reason to consider a microframework is that you are in control of everything and that is good in my book.  It&#8217;s one of my arguments for choosing <span class="caps">MVC</span> over WebForms.  No unnecessary injection of client side code or script managers or any of that sort of thing.  No overly complex view properties being populated for no reason.  Nothing but the stuff you put in.</p><p>Not exactly within the bounds of a microframework by definition but still worth mentioning is hosting.  <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> has a number of hosting options</p><ul>	<li>Standalone</li>	<li>In a web app</li>	<li>In a <span class="caps">WCF</span> Service</li></ul><p>This sort of swappable hosting greatly increases portability of your app.  Now this is <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> specific but the effort required to create this sort of functionality with another microframework is trivial in comparison to the what it would be in <span class="caps">MVC</span> or WebForms.</p><p>Also many of the microframeworks have some sort of support for <a href="http://owin.org/"><span class="caps">OWIN</span></a> which is essentially a web abstraction that would allow your app to run on any <span class="caps">OWIN</span> supported server<sup class="footnote" id="fnr3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.  This sort of support would take longer to roll out across the larger frameworks which generally stick to <span class="caps">IIS</span>.  I&#8217;m not saying it won&#8217;t happen but the bigger your framework the slower change is going to happen.</p><p>That brings me to my final point &#8211; evolution.  <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span> has evolved very fast since v1.0 and there is no sign of that progress abating any time soon.  Still it&#8217;s speed is hindered by it&#8217;s size. These microframeworks introduce new features (some experimental for the brave among us) much faster because of the fact they are small.  Extending these frameworks don&#8217;t require the creation of numerous classes to do simple things &#8211; there is generally a common extension point with a very small set of requirements.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this has helped my colleagues get a better picture of why I think microframeworks are worthy of our time and why I am keen to do a bit of research on them.  I also hope this has broadened a few minds in terms of solution architectures in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.  Not everything needs to be some configurable, Enterprise ready, heavyweight application sometimes the simplest solution is all you need.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Provided you don&#8217;t do something stupid!</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> As a friend pointed out it&#8217;s easy to write a fast Hello World server so take these results with a healthy does of skepticism</p><p class="footnote" id="fn3"><a href="#fnr3"><sup>3</sup></a> It&#8217;s early days for <span class="caps">OWIN</span> but still worth mentioning.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>This post is a follow up to <a href="/blog/2011/04/04/a-tale-of-unit-testing-technologies/">A Tale of Unit Testing Technologies</a>.  Information about the project repository can be found on my <a href="/projects/unit-testing">projects page</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve finally managed to slog through the long and slightly tedious process of re-writing the same suite of tests in a number of C# and JavaScript unit testing technologies &#8211; the results of which can be seen on the <a href="http://github.com/kouphax/unit-testing">project GitHub page</a>.  My conclusion, especially in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world, is that it doesn&#8217;t really matter that much.  I know it&#8217;s not that much of a brilliant ending but what did you expect?  Fireworks?</p><p>Anyways before I start amazing you all with more awe inspiring revelations let me run through the remaining technologies (until such times as more are added at least) and summarise their good and bad points.  The other technologies I brought on board include,</p><ul>	<li><a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a></li>	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182486.aspx">MSTest</a></li>	<li><a href="http://nspec.org/">NSpec</a></li>	<li><a href="https://github.com/robconery/Quixote">Quixote</a></li>	<li><a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a></li>	<li><a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a></li></ul><p>Some obvious ones there just to round out the comparisons and a few JavaScript based ones.</p><h2><a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a></h2><p>Good old <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a>.  Whats not to love?  Mark a class as a fixture and mark your methods as a test.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/974990.js?file=NUnitTest.cs"></script><p>No point in mentioning too much about NUnit as most people will know the ins and outs of it already.  It has VS integration (via <a href="http://testdriven.net/">TestDriven</a>) and a nice NUnit runner capable of watching changes to DLL&#8217;s and automatically rerunning the test contained within.  One caveat around that is often NUnit hangs on to the <span class="caps">DLL</span> reference and requires a restart so Visual Studio can rebuild the <span class="caps">DLL</span> which kind of misses the point &#8211; but it doesn&#8217;t happen too often.</p><p>The framework itself would lend itself to a bit of betterification through sugar such as <a href="http://should.codeplex.com/">Should and Should.Fluent</a> but it does what it says on the tin.</p><h2><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182486.aspx">MSTest</a></h2><p>Another staple for many people.  I&#8217;d never really used it too much prior to doing this post because of the general negative opinion of it.  I must admit I kind of agree with some of these things.  It&#8217;s pretty much the MS equivalent of NUnit (in terms of features and look and feel)</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975043.js?file=MSTestTest.cs"></script><p>So why do so many people prefer NUnit over MSTest?  Well I think the main problem is that it is <a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2010/03/mstest-sucks-for-unit-tests.html">quite slow</a> in comparison (from Visual Studio at least) but my main gripe is the amount of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flob">flob</a> it generates for each test run and configuration.  It even produces solution folders for holding test runs and other files. If I want you to create those I&#8217;ll ask you &#8211; don&#8217;t force it on me.  It also has a very limited set of Assertion methods much like NUnit.</p><p>Enough moaning &#8211; surely it must have some benefits?  Well yes it does of course.  The main benefit <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is that it has very nice integration into Visual Studio which offers some very clean feedback.  This is something that requires <a href="http://testdriven.net/">TestDriven</a> for NUNit and the other frameworks which may or may not be free depending on your situation.</p><h2><a href="http://nspec.org/">NSpec</a></h2><p>Not to be confused with the <a href="http://nspec.tigris.org/">first hit on Google</a> which seems to be pretty much a dead project <a href="http://nspec.org">NSpec</a> (.org) is an attempt to bring <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> into the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975150.js?file=NSpecTest.cs"></script><p>This is somewhat similar to <a href="https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications">MSpec</a> I mentioned in the last post.  My bugbear with MSpec however was that it didn&#8217;t feel natural to me.  The equivalent MSpec test for the above looks like this,</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975159.js?file=MSpecTest.cs"></script><p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me but it doesn&#8217;t read as well as the NSpec version.  I even found it easier to write the NSpec version &#8211; more natural.</p><p>NSpec also has a lot of extra goodies.  Currently there is no integration into Visual Studio yet but the runner is simple to enough to spin up from the NuGet Package Manager Console and it has an added bonus of a file watcher.  <a href="http://nspec.org/continuoustesting">SpecWatchr</a> is similar to NUnit it can watch for changes and automatically run the specs.  It differs from NUnit in that it watches changes to the code files rather than the <span class="caps">DLL</span> &#8211; so need to wait for builds to happen etc.  Nice.</p><p>One minor gripe with it (bar the lack of VS support &#8211; even TestDriven support would be good) is the <code>should</code> syntax. I prefer the Should.Fluent style syntax <code>Should.Be()</code> rather than the current <code>should_be</code> syntax.  It&#8217;s not Ruby and we should accept that :-P.</p><p>It&#8217;s still quite early for NSpec and hopefully it keeps it&#8217;s momentum as it would be one of my frameworks of choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/robconery/Quixote">Quixote</a></h2><p>Quixote by Rob Conery follows on from his current slew of ultra lightweight solutions to common problems (like <a href="https://github.com/robconery/Massive">Massive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robconery/Sugar">Sugar</a>).  Quixote blends the <span class="caps">HTML</span> reporting directly with the framework and you write tests right in a Razor file.  This is the definition of lightweight.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975180.js?file=QuixoteTest.cshtml"></script><p>The obvious problem with this is that you don&#8217;t get continuous integration or build support.  There is no need to rebuild anything just refresh your page and the tests re-run.  Still CI/Build integration would be nice for a framework.</p><h2><a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a></h2><p>Ah Jasmine.  Jasmine is what I wanted out of a JavaScript testing framework.  Rather than going the JSpec route of creating a preprocessed <acronym title="Domain Specific Language"><span class="caps">DSL</span></acronym> Jasmine makes use of JavaScripts dynamic nature and &#8220;functions as 1st class citizens&#8221; feature to create framework that behaves like RSpec but embraces JavaScript.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975187.js?file=Tag.spec.js"></script><p>Out of the box you get an extensible framework (custom matchers etc), mocking and asynchronous support.  Ajax faking isn&#8217;t directly available but I recommend using <a href="http://sinonjs.org">Sinon</a> for this as it has an amazing FakeServer object that is fully configurable.</p><p>Another big advantage of Jasmine is it&#8217;s build integration.  Be it node.js, Java or Ruby you can integrate Jasmine specs into your build process.  .<span class="caps">NET</span> integration isn&#8217;t available yet but <a href="http://jurassic.codeplex.com">Jurassic</a> would be a suitable host if anyone wants to make it happen (hint, hint :-P).</p><h2><a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a></h2><p>And finally QUnit.  QUnit is the NUnit/JUnit equivalent for the JavaScript world.  Well known and mature project with some very nice <span class="caps">HTML</span> output.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/975220.js?file=Tag.test.js"></script><p>Not much else to say on this one right now&#8230;. must be running out of steam.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>And there you have it.  The first real post since the move and it&#8217;s a bit of a waffly long one.  Anyways what would be my recommendations?  Well for .<span class="caps">NET</span> I&#8217;m torn.  Currently I&#8217;d say NUnit with Should.Fluent extensions.  This is a nice combo for creating simple tests that people can execute from within Visual Studio.  However NSpec has potential &#8211; I&#8217;d like to see it grow a bit more and I&#8217;ll keep watching it.  Visual Studio integration would be aces though.  JavaScript on the other hand I have a clear cut winner.  Jasmine is awesome.  It&#8217;s boosted my code quality and productivity no end on recent projects and with the help of <a href="http://sinonjs.org">Sinon</a> for mocking and controlling Ajax it&#8217;ll be a long time before I am this happy with a .<span class="caps">NET</span> equivalent tech.  Fingers crossed for NSpec on that front.</p></div>
