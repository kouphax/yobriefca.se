  <div class="entry-content">  <p>It&#8217;s very early days (with regards to both code and documentation) but I though I amy as well put it out there.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> is a .<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Resource Bundler. Capable of concatenating and transforming <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files to lower request count and bandwidth requirements. It works with any .<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Framework/View Engine capable of running C# in the view</p></blockquote><p>What differentiates <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> from other resource bundlers out there is that it aims to provided a bare bones, minimum feature set for building bales (or resource bundle).  The core <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler">Baler package</a> offers the ability to concatenate, render and cache JavaScript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> bales.  Thats it.  No minification nor fancy processing nothing.  However <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/baler/">Baler</a> does have 2 main extensibility hooks though (<code>Before</code> and <code>After</code>) which can be leveraged to control how bundles are manipulated.  There are currently 3 extensions for Baler but more are on their way,</p><ol>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a> &#8211; Transforms <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> files into JavaScript</li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.Less">.<span class="caps">LESS</span></a> &#8211; Transforms <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.org/">.<span class="caps">LESS</span></a> files into <span class="caps">CSS</span></li>	<li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.AjaxMinifier">Ajax Minifier</a> &#8211; Allows for minification of JavaScript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> using Microsofts Ajax Minifier</li></ol><h2>Quick Example</h2><script src="https://gist.github.com/998778.js?file=BalerExample.aspx"></script><p>This example will take 3 source files concatenate them into a random script file and output the necessary <code>&lt;script src='1jdk2ds.js' type='text/javascript'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.  Subsequent calls that match this bales signature (the order and contents of the bale) will use the cached script tag and not perform that concatenation again.</p><p>As I say it&#8217;s early days.  I really need to get the docs up to snuff, write plenty of test and add a few more features before I start shouting from the rooftops but at least it&#8217;s out now and there is no going back :-).</p><p>Baler v0.1 is available on <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/CodeSlice.Web.Baler">Nuget</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/baler.git">Github</a> and the annotated source code is available <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/Baler.html" title="Core">here</a>, <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.AjaxMinifier/MinificationExtensions.html" title="AjaxMin Extensions">here</a>, <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.CoffeeScript/CoffeeScriptExtensions.html" title="CoffeeScript Extensions">here</a> and <a href="http://kouphax.github.com/baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler/CodeSlice.Web.Baler.Extensions.Less/LessExtensions.html" title=".LESS Extensions">here</a></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p>Soooooo anyway I had the day off today and you know what they say &#8211; the devil makes work for idle hands.  And boy did that devil dude really go to town on me.  Earlier this morning I came across a tweet.  The sort of tweet that I like.  A highly polarising tweet that makes geeks stand up and cheer and makes everyone else feel like we are laughing at them.  Anyway heres the tweet,</p><blockquote><p><cite>&#8220;pragmaticpat: adults are &#8220;pro homework&#8221; for children, yet frequently do not study their craft outside of m-f, 9-5 #leadbyexample ?&quot;</cite></p></blockquote><p>So anyway I thought, as I was waiting in the car for the wife to finishing shopping or whatever she was doing at the time, I would throw this tweet up to our <a href="http://yammer.com">Yammer</a> community and stir up a bit of debate.  Things got a bit heated, more than even I would have liked.  In fact I think I offended people<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Lets say just I am beyond passionate about my job almost obsessively so in some respects.  Being that type of person I often expect everyone else to be just like me and therefore measure people against what I do.  I also tend to make statements as if there were 2 types of people in the world.  People like me, who go home and do a bit of extra work/research and people who do their 9-5 allocated work and don&#8217;t care about anything.  But hey there&#8217;s a twist here &#8211; I&#8217;m not actually stupid &#8211; I know the world isn&#8217;t black and white, us and them, all or nothing.  I&#8217;m also not as horribly snobby or elitist as I make out (I am a bit but thats just the nature of a technology fanboy &#8211; defensive about their passions &#8211; suck it).</p><p>Anyways enough of the woe is me schtick, it&#8217;s boring.  I just want to say that I understand there are people out there who do their 9-5 and go home and actually have a life beyond the keyboard.  I was never implying people need to work 24/7 or they are coasting.  I realise I have a bit of a reputation of being an elitist uber-geek and therefore many people may have assumed that was what I was getting at.  However I know that in the 9-5 block a lot of people are contributing more that just their time to a single project and are going out of their way to do something decent rather than mediocre.  I&#8217;m happy for someone to say <cite>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with were I am&#8221;</cite> &#8211; hell I am sure they&#8217;ve worked hard to get were they are so why not?  What I&#8217;m not happy with is someone who <strong>expect</strong> the same kudos as people who go above and beyond just because they show their face everyday.  When I retweeted that tweet and even went as far as yamming it I was stating an opinion, an opinion that wasn&#8217;t directed at any particular people or any particular company for that matter, it was just a blanket statement.</p><p>On a similar note I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of seeing plenty of CV&#8217;s over the last few years as well as interviewing people and I must say the industry has it&#8217;s fair share of people who are guru&#8217;s on paper but ask them a question about something that they haven&#8217;t encountered due to work on a project and they are flummoxed.  It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs to get into that shape.  It&#8217;s a bit like a morbidly obese fitness instructor &#8211; they can do their job but neglected to look after themselves &#8211; who would want to hire that sort of person?  Not many people I&#8217;d bet.</p><p>So yeah I accept that there are many different types of people.  People who want to better the industry as well as themselves.  People who want to better themselves and the company they work for.  People who just want to better themselves.  People who just want to do a super job with the role they are given and finally people who just want to get by<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. But I refuse to accept that everyone should be treated equally in all respects and as long as people can respect that then we can all get along.</p><p>So whats the point of all this?  I know I have high standards but I also need to learn that not everyone wants the same thing out of life.  Or more to the point that other people actually <span class="caps">HAVE</span> a life outside of IT.  In the past I&#8217;ve had shed loads of opportunity to shine, but I&#8217;ve also been on some long boring pressured projects so I need to realise other people are going through that too.  I need to be a bit smarter about this.  It&#8217;s even part of my job description to mentor others so I suck at my job (hence the title).  Perhaps I should pull my finger out and ensure people are given opportunities to shine?  Yeah thats sounds about right&#8230;.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> For what it&#8217;s worth I wasn&#8217;t asked, request or ordered to write this.  As always I am doing this for my own reasons.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> I&#8217;m sure you could break it down more.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <blockquote class="announce">This post is the is part of series of posts covering the various <em>micro web frameworks</em> in the .<span class="caps">NET</span> world.  The frameworks I intend to cover will be linked as the series progresses.  For further discussion on the use of micro web framework in .<span class="caps">NET</span> please see my <a href="/blog/2011/05/18/why-use-micro-web-frameworks-in-net/">previous post</a> The current series line up:<ul>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/19/micro-web-frameworks-101-jessica/">Jessica</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/05/23/micro-web-frameworks-101-nancy/">Nancy</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/06/22/micro-web-frameworks-101-anna/">Anna</a></li>	<li><a href="/blog/2011/07/18/micro-web-frameworks-101-tinyweb//">Tinyweb</a><br></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="htttp://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> is a different beast to <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> while on the surface it may appear like a micro web framework, once you scratch the surface it becomes debatable because there is just some much more than a nice <span class="caps">DSL</span> for creating lightweight web apps.  In fact this was <a href="http://tombell.org.uk/blog/2011/04/10/why-did-i-create-jessica/">one of the reasons</a> Jessica was created,</p><blockquote><p>Nancy has taken an approach to making many parts of the framework replaceable; if you don?t like the functionality of X you can create your own, and have Nancy use that instead. While this is a respectable goal for a web framework, the focus for Jessica has been to stay as simple and as close to Sinatra as possible. <em>Tom Bell.  Why Did I Create Jessica?</em></p></blockquote><p>Anyway we will touch on these aspects a bit later.  Lets get cracking.</p><h2>Getting Started &#8211; Hello World</h2><p>Getting <a href="htttp://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> up and running is simple enough.  Starting with an empty <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> web project<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> we can use <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> to install Nancy</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985446.js?file=InstallPackage.cs"></script></p><p>Also because we are hosting this in an <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> environment (more on this later) we need to install the appropriate hosting package</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985450.js?file=InstallPackage.ps"></script></p><p>Next step requires us to add some stuff to the <code>web.config</code>.  If you&#8217;ve been smart and installed the hosting package from NuGet this steps is done for you but ultimately your minimal <code>web.config</code> should look like this.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985454.js?file=Web.config.xml"></script><p>The final step is to create the hello world module that will handle your route.  Again, like Jessica, it doesn&#8217;t matter where the module classes are placed but for neatness I just like to stick them in a <code>Modules</code> folder.  Our module will look very similar to the one we defined for Jessica.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985460.js?file=HelloWorldModule.cs"></script><p>And we&#8217;re done.  Fire the app up and behold the &#8220;Hello World&#8221;-yness of it all.</p><h2>Other Micro Framework Related Stuff</h2><p><a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> has some features that aren&#8217;t technically related to the micro framework aspect  &#8211; specifically hosting but I&#8217;ll touch on that later.  <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> also has a lot of nice features that are related to the micro framework aspects so lets take a bit of a whirlwind tour around the main areas first.</p><h3>Routes</h3><p>Routes in <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> are pretty powerful.  Obviously you get the declare static routes (as demonstrated above) but dynamic routes (routes with variables for example) are also supported in a few of ways.  First of all you have named segments.  These can be expressed in 2 ways</p><ol>	<li>Sinatra style variables <code>/user/:id</code>, or,</li>	<li>C#-esque <code>String.format</code> style <code>/user/{id}</code></li></ol><p>Declaring a route like this will cause the variable section to be pushed into a named variable within the dynamic object passedin into the route action. <code>/user/jameshu</code> matches <code>/user/:id</code> and the dynamic object passed into the action will have <code>x.id == "jameshu"</code></p><p>The other means of dynamic route matching is the use of regular expressions and named capture groups (or backreferences as they are sometimes known).  Using regular expressions as route parameters allows us to offer more fine grained route matching.  Take the following route as an example,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985797.js?file=Route.cs"></script></p><p>This route will <span class="caps">ONLY</span> match routes whose variable section matches the expression, in this case a numeric value.  So not only have we specified a route variable but we are also limiting access to that action to &#8220;valid&#8221; values.  This means we could also offer another route that accepts only alphabetical characters.  Powerful enough.</p><h3>Route Conditions</h3><p>Taking routes another step further <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> also offers optional conditions that can be used to determine if a route should be executed for a given request.  Lets use this heavily contrived example to demonstrate this feature,</p><p class="minimal-gist"><script src="https://gist.github.com/985818.js?file=SecretRoute.cs"></script></p><p>So this route will match any route starting with <code>/user</code> however the condition (the second argument of the definition) will ensure that the route action will only get executed if the query string is populated with an argument called password with a value of secrets i.e <code>http://myserver/user?password=secrets</code> will match successfully.</p><h3>Views</h3><p><a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> supports a decent range of view engines<sup class="footnote" id="fnr2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p><ul>	<li>Razor</li>	<li>Spark</li>	<li>NDjango and, obviously,</li>	<li>Static files</li></ul><p>Serving up dynamic vies is fairly simple</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985832.js?file=ModuleWithView.cs"></script><p>We basically use the View object to specify the view and optionally pass in a view model as well.  By default Nancy will look in the <code>~/Views</code> folder for the views but you can also specify a full path if needs be.  The view is then matched against the available view engines and rendered as you would expect.  This is the Razor view specified above.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/985835.js?file=View.cshtml"></script><h3>Responses</h3><p>Nancy is also capable of returning static content as different responses (similar to how Jessica does it).  Each route action is expected to return a Nancy Response object. The object itself has a number of convenience methods for serving static files and <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></acronym> such as <code>Response.AsJs</code>, <code>Response.AsJson</code>, <code>Response.AsXml</code>, , <code>Response.AsRedirect</code> etc.</p><h2>Hosting</h2><p>This is were things move away from &#8220;micro framework&#8221; world a bit.  Nancy itself abstracts out the hosting environment making the entire framework portable allowing you to host in any number of places including (but not limited to),</p><ul>	<li>Self hosted (e.g. embedded within an executable)</li>	<li><span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span>/<span class="caps">IIS</span> (as demonstrated above)</li>	<li><span class="caps">WCF</span> (yep thats right), and,</li>	<li>Some partial <a href="http://bvanderveen.com/a/dotnet-http-abstractions"><span class="caps">OWIN</span></a> support</li></ul><p>This, to me at least, is very interesting.  Being able to build an executable that accepts <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests could be pretty powerful in the right hands and the <span class="caps">WCF</span> stuff sounds very interesting (is this similar to what the new <span class="caps">WCF</span> Web <span class="caps">API</span> is attempting to offer?).  I need to play some more in this area.  I&#8217;ll report back when I am done.</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>So that was a quick round up of the key features of Nancy and I think it&#8217;s another one worth looking at.  So hopefully you can also see how it differs from Jessica.  From a code perspective they seem quite similar (though Nancy has possibly a few more features) but the whole hosting abstraction layer is very interesting.  I have had people ask me if this introduced any new (or even old) security concerns and to be honest I don&#8217;t know but it might certainly be worth looking out for.</p><p>As always I may need corrections so please fire away.  Hopefully I can cover off these points with a few more screencasts over the next week.  Stay tuned.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> In my <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> I laid out steps to strip the normal <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> Web Project template out of all the unnecessary bits.  Lord knows why I didn&#8217;t just create an empty web project &lt;facepalm/&gt;</p><p class="footnote" id="fn2"><a href="#fnr2"><sup>2</sup></a> Apparently it also has a built in view engine called the Super Simple View Engine but as of yet I can&#8217;t seem to get it to work.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content">  <p><span class="caps">SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENCASTS</span> <span class="caps">GALORE</span>!</p><p>So I unveiled the new <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> section of the site.  Can you guess whats in it?  Those who said &#8220;screencasts&#8221; you can have a nice non-patronising pat on the head.  The rest of you&#8230;. for shame.  Tut tut.</p><p>Anyways I wanted to start a series of short <a href="/screencasts">screencasts</a> that will provide a practical view of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> Micro Web Framework series.  So far I&#8217;ve managed to cover the basics of <a href="http://jessicafx.org">Jessica</a> but there is more to come.</p></div>
