<p>Aint no backing out now son!  In 2012 there is going to be a Northern Ireland based <a href="http://givecamp.org">GiveCamp</a>.  The &#8220;Register Your Interest&#8221; placeholder site is now live at <a href="http://givecampni.org.uk/">http://givecampni.org.uk/</a> so if everyone can start spreading the word and getting excited that would be super awesome.</p>

<p>Any tips, advice or help at this point is also really welcome.</p>

<p>Let the fun begin&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>3 Nov 2011: As of Nancy v0.9 this is part of the core (same logic applies)</p></blockquote>

<p>I needed to write a simple JSONP capable service recently and decided to run with <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a>.  Turns out Nancy doesn&#8217;t give us a way to do JSONP so I set about creating something that fitted my use case.  The fruits of my very very short labour (thanks to the super-hyper-flexible-powerfulness of the Nancy Pipeline) can be seen here.  The full source is available in the <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/nancy-jsonp">Github repo</a> and hopefully we can get this pushed into the core of Nancy shortly (or at least part of the official repo one way or another) - just for the geek cred of course :)</p>

<p>I have procrastinated long enough on this and it was blocking some of the other work I wanted to get on with.  I have just pushed v0.1 to Nuget and launched the <a href="http://yobriefca.se/projects/fluentauth/">site sans documentation</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Data Access is a difficult area to master. There are plenty of frameworks such as Entity Framework, NHibernate, i/myBatis. These frameworks attempt to make data access simpler but while these products are widely used they can lead to leaky abstractions forcing us to work around constraints of the technology or introduce the nightmare of trying to figure out what is happening deep down in the frameworks internals.</p>

<p>In this session we will look at the various lightweight alternatives and the advantages they offer as well as provide rationale about why the more heavyweight approach isn&#8217;t always the best approach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So its the day after DDD North and I&#8217;m more or less getting packed and ready to do the long boring travel bit home, which is really less travelling and more waiting around.  Anyway DDD North was pretty special.  Excellent turn out, great location and above all some great talks.  My talk (refORM: Death to ORMs in .NET) had a technical problem with the projector which meant the live demo section I wove in since last weeks talk had to be abandoned, shit happens.  It also went very fast, the talk was over in about 35 minutes but at least there was plenty of banter and questions - so at least the people seemed to be engaged.  Enough about my woes.  I&#8217;ll have the slides and the (super secret) demo code available as soon as get back home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;m no longer a conference speaker virgin.  It was so good I did it twice in the same day.  How&#8217;d it go?  Went good I guess.  From a conference stand point it seemed to fly by.  There was a kind of laid back atmosphere about the whole thing and the numbers, while lower than expected were high enough to make all the talks feel comfortably occupied.  I skipped the first block to get my talk prepared but managed to pull in a few talks after I got my first one over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little project recently that is using Tinyweb.  It&#8217;s a typical little CRUDdy app and makes use of typical security features in a web app.  Tinyweb itself doesn&#8217;t provide any sort of custom security features out of the box but as it sits on top of ASP.NET you can avail of all the normal membership stuff.  Problem is though - the default membership stuff, when working directly with it, is a bit cumbersome.  I recently tinkered with a project for ASP.NET MVC called <a href="http://www.fluentsecurity.net/">FluentSecurity</a> that added a fluent syntax to configuring security for ASP.NET MVC applications.  Taking a healthy dose of inspiration from this project I rolled a lightweight Tinyweb version of my own.  I figure this might be useful to someone else so I have now created a new project specifically for this.  It&#8217;s probably totally broken in areas but the areas I&#8217;ve written tests around appear to work.</p>

<p>The source is available in a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/tinyweb-fluentsecurity">BitBucket repository</a> so feel free to critique.  Once I get it tested better, documents written up and generally applied a bit of sipt and polish I&#8217;ll push it to Nuget and the fun can really begin.</p>

<h1>Tinyweb.FluentSecurity</h1>

<p>FluentSecurity comes as a 2 part solution</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>Security</code> class is the main entry point for configuring FluentSecurity and authenticating users</li>
<li>The <code>SecurityFilter</code> class is a Tinyweb filter that performs auth tests on the current request</li>
</ol>


<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The <code>Security</code> class provides a central location to configure FluentSecurity.  <code>Security</code> is also responsible for executing the auth tests you pass to it.</p>

<h3>Security.Configure(Action<Configurator> configurator)</h3>

<p><code>Configure</code> lets you define the configuration for you module.  It accepts an Action that can be used to define rules for each handler.  For example</p>

<pre><code>Security.Configure(c =&gt;
{
    c.For&lt;RootHandler&gt;().DenyAnonymousAccess();
    c.For&lt;AdminHandler&gt;().RequireRoles("Admin");
    c.For&lt;UserHandler&gt;().DenyRoles("Admin");
    c.For&lt;SecretHandler&gt;().AllowVerbs(Security.AllowedVerbs.GET | Security.AllowedVerbs.POST);
});

Tinyweb.Init();
</code></pre>

<p>We call <code>Security.Configure</code> just before we Init Tinyweb (though it can be done at anytime realistically speaking).  The configuration block shows off most of the ways you can configure handlers e.g.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>DenyAnonymousAccess</code> will prevent, as the name suggests, all anonymous users from accessing this handler</li>
<li><code>RequireRoles</code> specifes 1..N roles that are required to access this handler</li>
<li><code>DenyRoles</code> specifies 1..N roles that aren&#8217;t permitted to access this handler</li>
<li><code>AllowVerbs</code> restricts the HTTP Verbs that can be used to access this handler (PUT, POST, GET etc.)</li>
<li><code>WithCustomRule</code> (not listed) allows you to specify a function that can be used to apply a custom rule to each request</li>
</ol>


<p>Each method returns the configuration object so it is possible to chain the calls to create more complex rules.</p>

<pre><code>Security.Configure(c =&gt;
    c.For&lt;EditHandler&gt;()
        .DenyAnonymousAccess()
        .RequireRoles("Author")
        .DenyRoles("Reader")
        .AllowVerbs(Security.AllowedVerbs.POST);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously some combinations will not make sense, in fact AllowedVerbs needs to be tweaked as it may only apply to certain roles (so the combinations don&#8217;t make sense right now).  Currently FluentSecurity doesn&#8217;t care and it probably never will if you try and create illogical combinations.</p>

<h3>bool Security.Test(RequestContext req, HandlerData d)</h3>

<p>This will run all pre-configured rules against the current request to determine if the request is authorised to continue.  It will return a true/false result depengin on whether the rules pass or not.</p>

<pre><code>bool granted = Security.Test(context, data);
</code></pre>

<h3>IResult Security.Validate(RequestContext req, HandlerData d)</h3>

<p>Implements the typical SecurityFilter use case.  This function will call the <code>Test</code> method and returns <code>Result.None()</code> if the test passes (may be configurable in the future) otherwise it executes the <code>Security.OnAccessDenied</code> function and returns the <code>IResult</code>.  If no <code>OnAccessDenied</code> is defined <code>Result.None()</code> will be returned.</p>

<pre><code>IResult result = Security.Validate(context, data);
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply shorthand for now but may be expanded with some custom logic in the near future.</p>

<h3>Security.OnAccessDenied</h3>

<p>This property is used to define a function that can be used to return a result should access been denied.  This is done lazily as it allows you access to the <code>RequestContext</code> and <code>HandlerData</code> so you could implement per-request handling of the Result (redirects or return URLs etc.)</p>

<pre><code>Security.OnAccessDenied = (c, d) =&gt; Result.Redirect&lt;AccessDeniedHandler&gt;();
</code></pre>

<h2>SecurityFilter</h2>

<p>The <code>SecurityFilter</code> class is simply a Tinyweb filter that performs the request validation for authentication.  Nothing special here move along now.</p>

<h1>For Now and Up Next</h1>

<p>So thats all there is for now.  Code is, as I&#8217;ve said, available at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/tinyweb-fluentsecurity">BitBucket repository</a>.  I&#8217;m starting to build up some docs and stuff now and maybe tweak and add useful features.  If there is anything you would like to see raise it as an <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/tinyweb-fluentsecurity/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">issue</a> and I&#8217;ll get around to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the outside people probably regard me as a typically chaotic person.  My desk is a mess, I&#8217;m not mad keen on the whole shaving thing, my writing is terrible and I am generally not where people expect me to be at any particular time.  But there is, more often than not, a workflow that works for me hidden deep down in the chaos.  Most people stick to one or two way to organise themselves (Todo Lists, pen and paper, iPad etc.).  Not me.  I&#8217;m still trying to find some sort of process that fits well with me but I&#8217;m starting to think that perhaps that actually is my process.  I move from different mediums and tools quite a lot.  Doing this isn&#8217;t always easy given some tools just natrually try and lock you in.  My current workflow involves a few tools,</p>

<ul>
<li>Pen and paper (Work only).  Nothing beats its it immediate and short term loggin of free form information.  I have strict rules around it though.

<ul>
<li>Blank paper - no lines or binder holes or headers.  I guess I subconciouslly view this a restriction perhaps?</li>
<li>Black pen (with a bit of red).  I&#8217;ve totally gone off blue pen - it makes my notes look messy (they are though).  Pencil has been overtaken by the black ink pen these days though I am not sure why</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>. List management.  Cloud syncing. Free.  I moved from <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things.app</a> when I realised they just don&#8217;t seem to listen to their customers.  Cloud synching is essential.  Wunderlist offers me a cross platform and web based solution for doing everything I need quickly.  I use this for medium-longer term &#8220;listable&#8221; tasks such as,

<ul>
<li>Project Deliverables</li>
<li>General day to day work tasks (though not shopping lists - see later)</li>
<li>Things to blog about</li>
<li>Wish lists for presentas and books and things (shared with family who also do the same thing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iOS 5&#8217;s Reminders app.  Yeah ANOTHER list manager.  This one is for very short time lists such as shopping lists.  I find polluting Wunderlist with this sort of list very annoying.  I don&#8217;t use it that often but it&#8217;s the best app I find for ultra fast entry of lists.</li>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>.  The latest addition to my supposed system.  It&#8217;s essentially a multi-level list system.  Kind of like a cross between a Kanban board and a Todo list application.  I am currently using this for more and more things.  Essentially higher level list management that makes more sense to have a pseudo workflow or a board to collect realted lists and collaborate with others.  The key to this one is everything becomes more collaborative but it&#8217;s much less restictive than something like AgileZen.

<ul>
<li>Books (To Read, Reading, Finished)</li>
<li>Hackathon Voting (Ideas, Timings, Dates, Objectives etc).  Allows a bunch of people to vote and discuss relevant things for the next hackathon.  We also use checklists for things we need to prepare in advance etc.</li>
<li>House renovations (one list per room).  Shared between my wife and myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://agilezen.com/">AgileZen</a>.  Amazing site for Kanban and Scrum.  Essentially a Kanban board with enough flexbility/features that means we can tailor the workflow to suit the needs of the project and team.  I use this for work projects where feedback on times and bottlenecks is essential.  Can&#8217;t say enough great things about this.</li>
<li>Whiteboard - Ultra transient information.  I use this during real time <strong>brain thinking</strong> sessions.  An old friend remareked that the process of getting out of your chair and picking up a pen changes the way you think and creates a more open environment for ideas.  Generally items on the whiteboard last a couple of minutes.  Anything important can be photographed and sent to Evernote or email.  I do my best work at a whiteboard.  If I am blanking I get up and start doodling - inspiration eventually comes.  Currently there is a picture of Silos (pronounced Sigh Loss) - The Evil Data Overlord - makes sense to me.</li>
</ul>


<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/media/images/blog/silos.jpg" /></div>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.  Online storage of notes useful for indexing and searching.  To be honest - more information goes into this than comes out but it has saved my neck a few times with information I thought irrelevant.  I moved from OneNote because there was no suitable OneNote client for the devices I use.  Oh and I own a Mac.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a>.  I&#8217;m travelling a bit more these days and it is always nice to have all the necessary information in one place that actually assists planning by proving maps and schedules.  Assistive metasites are the future!</li>
<li>Fridge (one of those cold things in your kitchen) - My materialised Kanban board at home that I use for &#8220;hobby&#8221; activities when I am off work to let my wife know what I am up to and plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Calendar - Outlook synched to Google and available on all devices.  I don&#8217;t use this directly but other people do and I follow the instructions people send to me (if I think it&#8217;s worth my time).</li>
<li>Email - Most disorganised but oft used medium for retrieving information (usually once and discarded or archived to never be accessed again)</li>
</ul>


<p>So you see I have got a lot of stuff in a lot of places but luckily important information is exactly where I need it.  It may not seem sane or organised but for some reason it is to me - or maybe this is very very normal?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The start of October is going to be a busy time for me - in a good way.  The first weekend I&#8217;ll be doing two talks at <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/Schedule.aspx">DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper in Belfast</a> and the following week I&#8217;ll be skipping over to Sunderland (first time there) do do another talk for <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Schedule.aspx">DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper North</a>.  I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to land the same presentation for both DDD Belfast and DD North which means I have slightly less to prepare.  Not that it will be a drop in quality in anyway - no siree.</p>

<p>For the interested folk the two talks are outlined below.  The titles and synopsis are fairly childish/over-sensationalised (delete as you see fit) but thats the way I roll.  My opinion enjoys being passed around and so my talks will feature a heavy dose of it - with all necessary disclaimers attached.</p>

<p>For both events I&#8217;ll be covering,</p>

<blockquote><h1>refORM: Death to ORMs in .NET</h1>

<p>Data Access is a difficult area to master. There are plenty of frameworks such as Entity Framework, NHibernate, i/myBatis. These frameworks attempt to make data access simpler but while these products are widely used they can lead to leaky abstractions forcing us to work around constraints of the technology or introduce the nightmare of trying to figure out what is happening deep down in the frameworks internals.</p>

<p>In this session we will look at the various lightweight alternatives and the advantages they offer as well as provide rationale about why the more heavyweight approach isn&#8217;t always the best approach.</p></blockquote>

<p>And for DDD Belfast only,</p>

<blockquote><h1>CoffeeScript the Awesome</h1>

<p>CoffeeScript - &#8220;a little language that compiles into JavaScript&#8221; has been making a lot of noise in the web community with its inclusion in Ruby on Rail v3 and its swift rise in popularity on Github.</p>

<p>This session will look at the benefits this language brings over the native JavaScript alternative, the syntactical double rainbow it creates, the problems you&#8217;ll face and of course how you can actually use it in different technology stacks such as Ruby, node.js, .NET and Java.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve never really undertaken sessions of this size before (mostly internal or for a customer) so it&#8217;s going to be a cracking experience.  Hopefully people get as much out of these sessions as I will.  I&#8217;ll have whatever resources up after the events as well.</p>

<p>See you there (maybe).</p>
