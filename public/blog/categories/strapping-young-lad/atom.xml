    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have just released version 0.1.2 of <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/strapping-young-lad">Strapping Young Lad</a>.  Now we are getting to something that works a bit better across different platforms (now I just have to prove it to you).  This release sees the inclusion of multiple token replacement.  For example if I create a <code>.ladconfig</code> in the source repo with an array of tokens</p>

<pre><code>token: ['__NAME__', '__NAMESPACE__', '__AUTHOR__']
</code></pre>

<p>The user will be prompted to specify the values for these tokens before the engine goes off and does the replacement.  The <code>__NAME__</code> token is a bit special - you still need to specify the project name as part of the command line call so if SYL come across this token in the the list of configured tokens it will allow you to default that value without having to type it again, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>lad git@github.com:strapping-young-lad/Loam.git laddy

  Cloning git repository                OK
  Loading configuration                 OK
  Parsing tokens and stuff              
    name (laddy): 
    namespace: test.lad
    author: kouphax
                                        OK
  Processing files                      OK
  Processing directories                OK
  Moving project files                  OK

  Done processing 137 file(s)
  Done processing 22 directories(s)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice I didn't need to specify the name of the project again and then I was prompted for the second and third token values.  Simple stuff.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>So there are a few outstanding efforts to go in now.  Namely push some more templates into the SYL repo and spin up a site that lets you search said templates and document all the little features of SYL.  They will come in time.</p>

<p>This is the life!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I have released the super simple, rough-as-hell, barely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/lad">Strapping Young Lad</a>(<a href="https://github.com/kouphax/strapping-young-lad">Source</a>).  It's fulfils a need I keep having but never really fixing.</p>

<h2>Evelvator Pitch</h2>

<p>SYL, or lad for short, will take a git repo, clone it and replace a bunch of tokens in it with the values you've supplied.</p>

<h2>Say Wha?</h2>

<p>This means you can create a bunch of base solution/project types for any language and SYL will simply do some basic file/folder renaming and file content replacing for a given token.  For example doing the following,</p>

<pre><code>lad /path/to/git/repo MyNewProject
</code></pre>

<p>Will do the following things,</p>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repo at <code>path/to/git/repo</code> into a temporary folder</li>
<li>Remove the <code>.git</code> folder from the repo</li>
<li>Check for the existence of a <code>.ladconfig</code> in the freshly cloned repo</li>
<li>If one exists it loads the config setting</li>
<li>Otherwise it falls back to the defaults</li>
<li>Replace all instances of the configured token (eg. <code>__NAME__</code>) in all files, directories and file contents with the project name (in our case <code>MyNewProject</code>)</li>
<li>Copy the new folder over to your current working directory (<code>./MyNewProject</code>)</li>
</ol>


<p>What this allows you to do is have a standard project template for pretty much anything (.NET, Ruby, Scala - listen I mean anything - if it a collection of folders and files in a git repo then you set) and create a new instance with a few keystrokes - saving you time and potential RSI.</p>

<p>SYL was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/chucknorris/warmup">WarmuP</a> which is itself a gem but it requires you to be running .NET which for a lot of my requirement isn't going to cut it.</p>

<p>If you want to see what a typical template project looks like try <a href="https://github.com/amirrajan/Loam">Amir's Loam repo</a>.  This is a WarmuP project but works just fine.  With SYL you can create a <code>.ladconfig</code> file to override some of the conventions - get the source README linked above.</p>

<h2>Whats Next</h2>

<p>Yep it's pretty damn basic right now but it satifies most of my needs right now.  There are a few things I want to add for myself but I didn't release this for ME, I am pretty sure this will be of use to someone in some community in some shape or form.  With that in mind here are some features I think would take this to the next level,</p>

<ol>
<li>Specifiying multiple tokens e.g. <code>__NAME__</code> and <code>__NAMESPACE__</code> and <code>__YEAR__</code> etc. etc.</li>
<li>Post processing actions (e.g. <code>bundle install</code> or <code>npm install</code> or <code>sbt compile</code> or something like that)</li>
<li>A catalog - I have a <a href="https://github.com/strapping-young-lad">github organisation</a> with no repos setup right now but this would be a brilliant place to hold a load of templates compatible with SYL, don't ya think?  Then I could roll a site like rubygems or npmjs.org and make the projects searchable etc.  If you build it, they will come.  Maybe, who knows.</li>
</ol>


<p>So if you like it - HIGHFIVE - if not - it's all good.  Now go break it and criticise me.</p>
