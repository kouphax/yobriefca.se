    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data Access is a difficult area to master. There are plenty of frameworks such as Entity Framework, NHibernate, i/myBatis. These frameworks attempt to make data access simpler but while these products are widely used they can lead to leaky abstractions forcing us to work around constraints of the technology or introduce the nightmare of trying to figure out what is happening deep down in the frameworks internals.</p>

<p>In this session we will look at the various lightweight alternatives and the advantages they offer as well as provide rationale about why the more heavyweight approach isn't always the best approach.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CoffeeScript - "a little language that compiles into JavaScript" has been making a lot of noise in the web community with its inclusion in Ruby on Rail v3 and its swift rise in popularity on Github.</p>

<p>This session will look at the benefits this language brings over the native JavaScript alternative, the syntactical double rainbow it creates, the problems you'll face and of course how you can actually use it in different technology stacks such as Ruby, node.js, .NET and Java.</p>
