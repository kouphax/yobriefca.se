    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I made it through my talk at DevWeek which might sound a little odd but it took a whole bottle of cough syrup to do it.  Not having been sick for most of the winter my body decided a day before DevWeek to go into shut down.  I spent Tuesday in bed with very little voice.  Thankfully the head colds hold on my vocal chords relented this morning and I think I managed to project as best I could.</p>

<p>So initial thoughts of how it went?  I honestly think I'm getting better at this presenting thing so that must be a good thing, unless I was TERRIBLE before.  The 2 main annoyances that have been raised thus far have been</p>

<h2>1. Too Short</h2>

<p>I did my usual "talk really fast and finish earlier than planned" thing I sometimes do. But there was plenty of discussion afterwards which I tought was interesting.  FWIW when I present this to myself it takes longer.  My internal monologue must be slower than the way I speak.  Apologies to anyone that felt it was "too short".</p>

<h2>2. Not enough Visual Studio</h2>

<p>I opted to play it safe end embed code into my slides rather than code live - I didn't go unnoticed and I had a few comments that "moar codez" would have been good.  Totally agree.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff</h2>

<p>I opted to change my slide deck between submitting them for print and presenting.  I did it out of desire to devlier a better, more structured, talk (my first set being quite short as I was going for a "free-form" type of presentation).  Probably not the most professional approach to do this but at least I can say my heart was in the right place :)  Here are offending articles BTW</p>

</div>


<p>Code that was presented is available, as always, in/on my <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/bddindotnet-code">Github Repo</a>.  Thanks to all who attended and any other feedback you have throw it my way so I can get better at this talking malarky.</p>

<p>Also thanks to the folks at DevWeek for the opportunity - hopefully you'll have me back at some point.</p>
