    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I am sitting here, here being London - 315(ish) miles away from my family, halfway through the <a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> and having a bit of a personal crisis.  I often have these little episodes but this one has been languishing in my dusty old head for a good while - refusing to go away, nagging me every time I have a chance to ponder things.  It's the same old thing - why am I doing any of this stuff I do?  I don't generally get a great amount of opportunity in work to really stretch my creative urges.  That sort of thing happens on my own time and therefore given my other responsibilities (my wife, family and lifes associated activities) is done under a fairly tight deadline.  Add this to the fact I bore easily of things that aren't really benefiting people immediately - I tend to flit, easily, between little unfinished projects.  But wait....  I did it again.  You see back there, about 2 sentences ago I just sidelined my entire life.  Thrown between two looming brackets I relegated my wife and family to a byline yet again.  Oy vey.</p>

<p>And this brings me, neatly enough, to the point of this entire ramble.</p>

<p>Five years ago I married my awesome wife and in that time I've done a heap of things - relocated twice, had two kids bought a house, got promoted, pissed everyone off, seen a few countries and bought/traded three cars (which get smaller every time oddly enough).  And through all this hopping around my wife has been the one true constant.  She thinks, most of the time, I don't care about her - after all I'm in London participating in a hackathon on our 5th wedding anniversary because I stupidly didn't put two and two together and notice the clash.  So yeah it may damn well seem like she comes in a close second to my hobby/career stuff (you know the stuff I already mentioned was pulling into crisis mode).  But it's not true.  I can't help the fact I am "emotionally retarded", as my sister once called it, but perhaps once in a while I really should let her know that she means more than she thinks she does.  And here it is.  A little bit of emotional letting if you will.</p>

<p>Dear Emma - happy anniversary, I hope we have plenty more, thank you for putting up with me, you're aces.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late night ramblings...</p>

<p>Productivity can plateau very quickly - especially in a technical process.  No matter how good you get at the process or approach, if you keep doing the same thing you can only get so good at it or do it so fast.  It's possible, however, by sacrificing some of your precious time to go beyond that plateau.  There are things we, the developers, do as part of our development process that are so small and insignificant that we do them without thinking</p>

<ul>
<li>Clearing down the values in LocalStorage when debugging a web app</li>
<li>Copying assets from one folder to another (aka the macgyver deploy)</li>
<li>Navigating to <code>http://localhost:8000</code> or <code>9000</code> or some other port</li>
<li>Typing <code>rake generate preview</code> into the terminal about 20 times an hour</li>
<li>These are but a few things I've had to consider today alone</li>
</ul>


<p>Generally these things are so small we'd just do them by hand, right?  But if you take the time to automate these processes or even just refine them in some way it can do wonders for you productivity going forward.</p>

<p>For example the clearing of LocalStorage in Chrome - spent a few minutes writing a bookmarklet that you can execute with 1 click.  The macgyver deploy?  Write a rake/make/jake/psake/cake task for it.  Better yet use <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mynyml/watchr">Watchr</a> and perform the deploy on save!  Navigatin to various different localhost ports?  Try my <a href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/04/03/alfred-hack-for-web-developers/">alfred script</a> to minimise the keystrokes. <code>rake generate preview</code> - alias that bad boy to <code>rgp</code>!  Save yourself those extra keystrokes - you might need them later.</p>

<p>Listen - specifics aren't important here.  You'll have your own small repetitive tasks and you'll be able to find your own ways to automate, improve or refine them - but this is the point.  You probably don't.  At least not as often as you should.  Losing a second here and there on one task means very little in the small.  In the large, across many of these tasks, well thats a different story.  It's hard to justify spending 10 or 20 minutes on something to automate a task that takes 5 seconds to run but even if the time doesn't repay for a while then the fact you have less of a cognitive shift between your primary task and this secondary one should allow you stay in the highly effective, productive mindset to get the job done.</p>

<p>So give it a go, even as a thought experiment - think about the habitual development tasks you do and how you could automate them - you could well suprise yourself (like I have been recently).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> for some time and use it to make pretty much everything a keystroke away.  I've thrown a very small little extension that reduces the time to jump between console and newly started web app.  Generally during development we need to run our app jump to <code>localhost:PORT</code> and make sure it's working.  If, like me, you have a lot of different apps and platforms (Scala, Jekyll, Rails, Sinatra, Express to name a few) then <code>PORT</code> becomes the one thing you always need to type and the browsers auto predict is generally not that helpful in this situation.</p>

<p>Alfred to the rescue here, just create a script as shown below and then running alfred and typing <code>l 9000</code> you can launch your default browser at <code>http://localhost:9000</code>.  Very simple but saves me heaps of time at the minute.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ya'll about ready for another silly analogy?  I sure am....</p>

<p>I work on the 6th floor and recently decided to start taking the stairs.  Mostly because I've let myself go and I really need to drop a few pounds and those stairs are a bit of a hard slog.  But it's worth it.  <!-- more --> It's funny how much of a better understanding of the building layout I get by just putting in the extra effort and going up the stairs.  The stairwell itself is pretty bland but I see extra doors, and I now know were many of doors could lead.</p>

<p>So the analogy... Taking the stairs is a bit like the whole software craftsmanship thing.  Sure I could just take the prescribed route, the default stack so to speak, and as with the stairs I'd probably get where I was going for a lot of the time.  But you know what?  I'd not know much more than the average person.  What if that lift was over capacity, out of order or just smelling of urine - I'd be able to manage just fine without getting stranded on a random floor wondering what to do next, if that door I never tried went were I wanted.  Imagine the stress involved if I was already late for a meeting.  Crickey!</p>

<p>So I put the extra effort in to understand things, and it's already given me a better perspective on things.  It's shown me other options, the ability to decide if the what I am doing is a good approach or perhaps there is a quicker, better, healthier route.</p>

<p>How does that grab you?</p>

<p>I really need to get off this analogy trip I'm on FFS!</p>

    <updated>2012-02-12T19:36:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/02/12/the-estimation-4x4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This post is dedicated to one of the most influential managers I've ever had the pleasure to work with.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm of the opinion that the moment you start trying to apply complex mathematical rigour and time to estimation you've entered into a broken system. <!-- more --> You're wasting time trying to protect yourself from finger pointing managers or getting a kicking from old school "us or them" lawyer types. None of that adds anything to the project except a big stick to beat people with and make sure they work themselves to death based a a random stab in the dark that is somehow made more realistic by the application if science. Ultimately though if the initial guesswork is wrong, and it's seldom on the nose, the science means sweet FA. So why bother? You're pleasing the wrong people. But then those people hold a lot of power.  So as long as we can keep them happy with the minimum of effort life should be sweet.</p>

<h2>The Answer</h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen I bring you the <strong>Estimation 4x4</strong> - guaranteed to knock those super science estimation techniques out of the park.</p>

<h2>The Science Bit</h2>

<p>Got a project to estimate?  I've done your homework for you - <strong>4 people, 4 weeks</strong>.  BOOM!  Mind Blown!  Now get on with delivering that project bro.  Oh wait it's a big ass project - 4 people, 4 months.  Oh wait you're limited by deadlines and/or resourcing - adjust as needed (3 people, 5 weeks or 5 people, 3 weeks).</p>

<h2>Balancing Act</h2>

<p>Careful now, 9 women dont make a baby in 1 month so don't assume that scaling one side up to cater for the other will get the same results.  Theres a balance that needs addressed.  This is real science after all - repsect the rule and the rule will respect you.</p>

<h2>You Gotta Be Kidding Me</h2>

<p>Dont believe me?  Try it out next time.  Do your pseudo-scientific enterprise-ready finger in the air analysis.  But hey see when that project is finished see how close the 4x4 would have brought you to the real result.  I bet 9 times out of 10 it was as accurate as your real estimate, except you could have started much sooner....</p>
