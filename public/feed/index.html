    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I have released the super simple, rough-as-hell, barely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/lad">Strapping Young Lad</a>(<a href="https://github.com/kouphax/strapping-young-lad">Source</a>).  It&#8217;s fulfils a need I keep having but never really fixing.</p>

<h2>Evelvator Pitch</h2>

<p>SYL, or lad for short, will take a git repo, clone it and replace a bunch of tokens in it with the values you&#8217;ve supplied.</p>

<h2>Say Wha?</h2>

<p>This means you can create a bunch of base solution/project types for any language and SYL will simply do some basic file/folder renaming and file content replacing for a given token.  For example doing the following,</p>

<pre><code>lad /path/to/git/repo MyNewProject
</code></pre>

<p>Will do the following things,</p>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repo at <code>path/to/git/repo</code> into a temporary folder</li>
<li>Remove the <code>.git</code> folder from the repo</li>
<li>Check for the existence of a <code>.ladconfig</code> in the freshly cloned repo</li>
<li>If one exists it loads the config setting</li>
<li>Otherwise it falls back to the defaults</li>
<li>Replace all instances of the configured token (eg. <code>__NAME__</code>) in all files, directories and file contents with the project name (in our case <code>MyNewProject</code>)</li>
<li>Copy the new folder over to your current working directory (<code>./MyNewProject</code>)</li>
</ol>


<p>What this allows you to do is have a standard project template for pretty much anything (.NET, Ruby, Scala - listen I mean anything - if it a collection of folders and files in a git repo then you set) and create a new instance with a few keystrokes - saving you time and potential RSI.</p>

<p>SYL was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/chucknorris/warmup">WarmuP</a> which is itself a gem but it requires you to be running .NET which for a lot of my requirement isn&#8217;t going to cut it.</p>

<p>If you want to see what a typical template project looks like try <a href="https://github.com/amirrajan/Loam">Amir&#8217;s Loam repo</a>.  This is a WarmuP project but works just fine.  With SYL you can create a <code>.ladconfig</code> file to override some of the conventions - get the source README linked above.</p>

<h2>Whats Next</h2>

<p>Yep it&#8217;s pretty damn basic right now but it satifies most of my needs right now.  There are a few things I want to add for myself but I didn&#8217;t release this for ME, I am pretty sure this will be of use to someone in some community in some shape or form.  With that in mind here are some features I think would take this to the next level,</p>

<ol>
<li>Specifiying multiple tokens e.g. <code>__NAME__</code> and <code>__NAMESPACE__</code> and <code>__YEAR__</code> etc. etc.</li>
<li>Post processing actions (e.g. <code>bundle install</code> or <code>npm install</code> or <code>sbt compile</code> or something like that)</li>
<li>A catalog - I have a <a href="https://github.com/strapping-young-lad">github organisation</a> with no repos setup right now but this would be a brilliant place to hold a load of templates compatible with SYL, don&#8217;t ya think?  Then I could roll a site like rubygems or npmjs.org and make the projects searchable etc.  If you build it, they will come.  Maybe, who knows.</li>
</ol>


<p>So if you like it - HIGHFIVE - if not - it&#8217;s all good.  Now go break it and criticise me.</p>

<blockquote><p>So we&#8217;ll criticise him, because he can take it&#8230;. [The Dark Knight, Approx.]</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> for some time and use it to make pretty much everything a keystroke away.  I&#8217;ve thrown a very small little extension that reduces the time to jump between console and newly started web app.  Generally during development we need to run our app jump to <code>localhost:PORT</code> and make sure it&#8217;s working.  If, like me, you have a lot of different apps and platforms (Scala, Jekyll, Rails, Sinatra, Express to name a few) then <code>PORT</code> becomes the one thing you always need to type and the browsers auto predict is generally not that helpful in this situation.</p>

<p>Alfred to the rescue here, just create a script as shown below and then running alfred and typing <code>l 9000</code> you can launch your default browser at <code>http://localhost:9000</code>.  Very simple but saves me heaps of time at the minute.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-03T13:30:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/04/03/rails-is-not-a-gateway-drug</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>WARNING!!! - a negative opinion on Rails lies ahead.  Everything here needs to be taken with an <strong>IMHO</strong> and, if you feel so inclined, tell me to go mind my own business.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know I&#8217;m stepping into very dangerous territory here but I&#8217;ve come to the very solid conclusion that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, Ruby&#8217;s heavily opinionated web framework, is not the gateway drug people claim.  I&#8217;ve heard the claims that if you give <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> a try, coming from some other web stack on any other language, you&#8217;ll fall in love with Ruby and Rails and write a big long blog post about how you are leaving .NET (or Java or whatever) behind.  I really dont get it&#8230;. the only feeling that Rails leaves me with - having been using it in anger for about a month now - is frustration.  But before you drive rusty nails into my hands and feet let me at least explain where I am coming from.</p>

<h2>Previous attempts</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been binging on Ruby for the last few months but this hasn&#8217;t been my first time - it&#8217;s been my only successful time but certianly not my first.  A year previous I had given Ruby/Rails a shot and it never stuck (in fact not once but at least twice).  Coming from a predominantly .NET/ASP.NET MVC background I decided the best approach would be to cut my teeth on a medium sized web based project and therefore jumped right into Rails.  It only took a short time before the whole effort felt like a slog full of weird semi-magic behaviour.  I gave up.</p>

<h2>Doing things differently</h2>

<p>This time around I decided to do things a little differently - rather than run with a web project I just tinkered with the language and eventually tried porting a <a href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/03/12/sentamentalizer/">.NET project over to Ruby</a>.  Fair bit of Ruby code and a small <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a> app later - it clicked.  I got the whole Ruby love affair, it was lovely and I was three lines into my <em>&#8220;F**k you .NET, you&#8217;re worse than Java and I hate you and you smell&#8221;</em> blog post (not factual!!) when I realised I needed to give Ruby more time to bed in and, out of fairness, I had to at least experience Rails.</p>

<h2>Present Day</h2>

<p>And with that I discovered that Rails had been my problem.  I find it incredibly frustrating.  I don&#8217;t want to dive into bashing Rails, thats not my intent, - I&#8217;m sure people find it really productive - but it&#8217;s not for me.  So here is a very high level executive summary of the problems I&#8217;ve had with Rails</p>

<p><strong>The Command Line Interface</strong></p>

<p>The CLI stuff has just a little bit too many features and options that make it a difficult thing to approach without extensive research.  When I watched some of the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> I found myself going &#8220;wait, HOW did he do that?&#8221; more than once.  Choice is good but surely Rails is supposed to be easy for the beginner?  Yet I feel the default options are not the ones I would have picked.  You know what - I want to be hand-held once in a while, I&#8217;m proud to admit that.</p>

<p><strong>Too Much Magic</strong></p>

<p>Rails is very heavily convention based but often there is simply too much convention and I&#8217;ve been left baffled a few times.  Some of the convention is well documented and some of it less so.  When a convention is not obvious it becomes magic and it really feels Rails has a lot of &#8220;magic&#8221;.  Thats not something I want.  To be honest I&#8217;d rather write the same 2/3 lines of boilerplate if it meant that, to a new developer, they could understand the convention better.  Take this very trivial example,</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HomeController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the same in ASP.NET MVC</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HomeController</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Controller</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">ActionResult</span> <span class="nf">Index</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">View</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To me that one line <code>return View()</code> tell me that this action will return a View, and now I can infer the convention of <code>home/index.cshtml</code> that wee bit easier.  When you start adding in more conventions, a little bit of extra code makes all the difference.  Conventions don&#8217;t scale unless clearly marked IMHO.</p>

<p><strong>Bloatyness</strong></p>

<p>When you generate scaffold in a Rails app, as a typical new developer would, you end up with a awful lot of files.  If I generate a new entity for example this is what I am greeted with,</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong - it&#8217;s nice to be given all these things for free, but it&#8217;s ultimatley stuff I end up ripping out anyway.  In .NET there is a running joke that the &#8220;Empty ASP.NET MVC Project&#8221; Template is anything but.  To me this is the same issue except it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d have to clean up everytime I use the <code>generate scaffold</code> command.  This seems worse to me.</p>

<h2>Current Thoughts</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure were Rails is supposed to stand.  I hear it&#8217;s great for beginners or for big sites but I couldn&#8217;t recommend it for either right now.  I realise I should really give it more time before rejecting it entirely but I feel that would be more time wasted.  Rails doesn&#8217;t make me more productive, at least not right now&#8230; perhaps once I repeat the same steps over and over and they become natural I&#8217;ll see a greater boost in productivity (Ruby on the other hand felt natural and great right away).  Perhaps if I shun the generators and roll my own stuff then I&#8217;ll be more productive - but then why not use another framework that comes without all the gubbins I don&#8217;t need?  Sinatra is nice and simple and I can build upon it rather than breakling it apart.  <a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a> seems like a great &#8220;next step up&#8221; from Sinatra but without as much (perceived) bloat as Rails.  I&#8217;ve also followed the recent <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397300529/railsapp">Kickstarter debacle</a> from Yehuda - and I agree with him and his mission.</p>

<p>So what I am trying to say is - if you are a person wanting to give the Ruby world a fair shake - DONT start on Rails.  Start simpler and later, if you want, when you&#8217;ve been throughly sold on the Ruby way, try Rails to see what you think.  Start with Ruby, port some code, write a Sinatra app, watch the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> as they are amazing then consider immersing yourself in Rails.</p>

<h2>Educate Me</h2>

<p>Finally - educate me.  I&#8217;m not some sort of oracle proclaiming the death of a framework that thousands of people love.  I&#8217;m not going to make anyone stop and think &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing wrong all my life - screw Rails&#8221;.  If I&#8217;m wrong - tell me.  If you think I need to give Rails another look - tell me why, tell me how.  If you care - show me what I&#8217;m missing.</p>

    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/04/02/setting-the-selected-option-in-a-select-with-selenium-in-scala</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a perfect bit of alliteration there in that title - right?  Anyway I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of work with bare-metal Selenium stuff in Scala recently and one of the things that kept me stumped for a while was setting the selected <code>option</code> for a particular <code>select</code> element.</p>

<p>I looked around the interwebs and didn&#8217;t really find anything - now I&#8217;m not saying it isn&#8217;t out there, I am certain it is, but I couldn&#8217;t find it.  So I decided to document how I did it in case any lone sole is stuck in a similar situation&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scala'><span class='line'><span class="n">driver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">findElement</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;year&quot;</span><span class="o">)).</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">findElements</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">By</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tagName</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;option&quot;</span><span class="o">)).</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">).</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">setSelected</span><span class="o">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So here I am simply finding the second <code>option</code> of the &#8220;year&#8221; <code>select</code> element and setting it selected.  I know it looks obvious now but trust me I was scratching my head for an age on this one.</p>

<p>I hope it helps some one, eventually :)</p>

    <link href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/03/28/done-spoked-at-devweek/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-28T13:19:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/03/28/done-spoked-at-devweek</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I made it through my talk at DevWeek which might sound a little odd but it took a whole bottle of cough syrup to do it.  Not having been sick for most of the winter my body decided a day before DevWeek to go into shut down.  I spent Tuesday in bed with very little voice.  Thankfully the head colds hold on my vocal chords relented this morning and I think I managed to project as best I could.</p>

<p>So initial thoughts of how it went?  I honestly think I&#8217;m getting better at this presenting thing so that must be a good thing, unless I was TERRIBLE before.  The 2 main annoyances that have been raised thus far have been</p>

<h2>1. Too Short</h2>

<p>I did my usual &#8220;talk really fast and finish earlier than planned&#8221; thing I sometimes do. But there was plenty of discussion afterwards which I tought was interesting.  FWIW when I present this to myself it takes longer.  My internal monologue must be slower than the way I speak.  Apologies to anyone that felt it was &#8220;too short&#8221;.</p>

<h2>2. Not enough Visual Studio</h2>

<p>I opted to play it safe end embed code into my slides rather than code live - I didn&#8217;t go unnoticed and I had a few comments that &#8220;moar codez&#8221; would have been good.  Totally agree.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff</h2>

<p>I opted to change my slide deck between submitting them for print and presenting.  I did it out of desire to devlier a better, more structured, talk (my first set being quite short as I was going for a &#8220;free-form&#8221; type of presentation).  Probably not the most professional approach to do this but at least I can say my heart was in the right place :)  Here are offending articles BTW</p>

<div style="max-width:500px;margin:0 auto;">
    <script src="http://speakerdeck.com/embed/4f719e7aca692c002101c187.js"></script>
</div>


<p>Code that was presented is available, as always, in/on my <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/bddindotnet-code">Github Repo</a>.  Thanks to all who attended and any other feedback you have throw it my way so I can get better at this talking malarky.</p>

<p>Also thanks to the folks at DevWeek for the opportunity - hopefully you&#8217;ll have me back at some point.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know <a href="http://krillapps.com/coderunner/">CodeRunner</a> right?  If not maybe you should go check it out.  It&#8217;s and aptly named little tool for running code snippets in various languages much like what <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LinqPad</a> does for the .NET folks.  I&#8217;ve been using it extensivley recently to test out little Ruby and Scala snippets.  Thing is though - I hit a snag.  By default CodeRunner will run the system ruby executable (1.8 in OSX) and I generally use <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> along with version 1.9.whatever so some of my scripts started behaving a little&#8230; odd.</p>

<p>But hey it&#8217;s an easy fix,</p>

<ul>
<li>Open your CodeRunner Preferences</li>
<li>Select the Languages tab</li>
<li>Select Ruby in the Language List</li>
<li>Change the run command from <code>ruby $filename</code> to <code>~/.rbenv/shims/ruby $filename</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>Before</h2>

<h2>After</h2>

<p><img class="borderless" src="http://yobriefca.se/images/blog/coderunnerruby/after.png"></p>

<p>Blam - global rbenv version is now the goto version for CodeRunner.  OK so it won&#8217;t work with rbenv locals but I am sure you can tweak it to make it work (I haven&#8217;t needed it so never looked).</p>

It&#8217;s obviously not the most complicated system in the world but hey it was new to me.</p>

<p>Anyway my current setup features a lot of html based pages (the default markdown approach didn&#8217;t fit due to styling needs) and it was getting rather noisy.  So I wrote, as there didn&#8217;t seem to be one out there, a <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a> generator.  And here it is,  step back it&#8217;s VERY COMPLEX&#8230;.</p>

<p>Just drop this file (call it anything) into your plugins folder in Jekyll/Octopress and any file with the <code>slim</code> extension will use this converter to generate HTML.  No more noisy HTML for me!</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t call yourself a language these days without having your own <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> clone.  Not even, it seems, if you are Java.  I know - it sounds odd that Java, the language that turns XML into stacktraces, has a micro web framework of it&#8217;s own - <a href="http://sparkjava.com">Spark</a>.  I&#8217;m well aware as of JRE 1.6 has a built in <code>HttpServer</code> class but there is such as thing as <strong>too close</strong> to the metal :)  Also Sparks logo is fairly epic.</p>

<p><a href="http://sparkjava.com">Spark</a>&#8217;s site has a great little piece about the &#8220;why&#8221; and that is what stuck with me.  Especially this bit,</p>

<blockquote><p>Its intention is to be used by Java developers that want or are required to develop in pure Java.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know a few people who are &#8220;required&#8221; to develop in pure Java and anything that might make their lives easier would be welcomed.  Being completely out of loop with Java since before Maven made an appearance I had a lot of catching up to do just to get the project running.  In fact I went with SBT as it made things a lot easier for me and my mavenless brain.  I did have to tinker with the dependencies in the <code>ivy2</code> directory due to a <a href="https://github.com/perwendel/spark/pull/15">known issue</a> but if I can do it anyone interested in this can to - if not give me a shout.</p>

<h2>App.java</h2>

<p>A Spark app simply uses <code>main</code> as an entry point.  Within the method you can call certain methods to set up routes and filters and whatnots that your app will respond to.  For example</p>

<p>Spark allows us to define filters that run before and after requests.  It is also possbile to restrict them to certain routes or simply catch all routes - for example my filter only matches the &#8220;/&#8221; route.  A couple of other things are worth mentioning here,</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>Request</code> object gives you access to many things you would expect i.e. the query parameters.  It gives you so much more than this but I&#8217;ll leave the <a href="http://www.sparkjava.com/readme.html#title2">docs</a> to describe this.</li>
<li>Just like in Sinatra it is possible to simply <code>halt</code> the request chain at any time.  Here I am halting execution unless the request conforms to my very strict and highly secure authentication scheme.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally I am defining a route (&#8220;/&#8221;) that responds to the GET verb and introspects the query parameters returning a very complex view.  Routes can also be parameterized (<code>/user/:name</code> for example). Even given the slightly verbose nature of Java syntax this example seems clean enough (albeit a rather simple example).</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A quick <code>sbt run</code> command and we are running a standalone Spark app (powered by an embedded Jetty server).  Aces.</p>

<h2>Mopping Up</h2>

<p>OK so thats the basics of the framework but then again there really isn&#8217;t much other stuff besides picking a port and redirecting.  This means there is some things still missing that would really make this framework really stand out,</p>

<ul>
<li>View rendering.  Even if it is just plain HTML it would be a big leap forward (turns out an <a href="https://github.com/perwendel/spark/issues/1">issue</a> is already open too).</li>
<li>Static Content.  Would be nice to define a rule for serving static content without having to define a route or filter manually</li>
<li>Session support.  Again an <a href="https://github.com/perwendel/spark/pull/12">issue and pull request</a> is already available for this.</li>
</ul>


<p>Good work <a href="https://github.com/perwendel/">perwendel</a> keep it up :)</p>

<p>As always my code samples are available on <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/spark-tinkering">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Cohn, Dan North, Robert C. Martin, Udi Dahan, Gojko Adzic, Billy Hollis, Laurent Bugnion, Venkat Subramaniam, Brad Wilson, Phil Haack, Rob Conery, Greg Young, Zach Holman&#8230;.. and then me.  So someone was drinking when deciding the line up for NDC Oslo right?</p>

<p>Seriously though I&#8217;ve been given one of the best opportunites of my career to talk alongside some of the shining lights of our industry at NDC Oslo so I better not drop the ball.  Thank you to whoever gave me the opportunity.  But hey if I mess up I&#8217;ve got another 2 shots at it&#8230; thats right I&#8217;m speaking not once, not twice but thrice.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-4960">.NET On a Diet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-4961">MonoTouch - C# + iOS = Good Times</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-4872">Mobile, How Do I Develop Thee? Let Me Count the Ways</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Still blown away by this, if you can&#8217;t tell - given the calibre of people talking this is going to be a highlight of the year for sure.  Also it couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time - there is so much I&#8217;ve wanted to say about things like the OSS world in .NET, Mono and mobile development. Now I&#8217;ve got the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p>Now whats this .NET thing I keep hearing about :)</p>

So the first thing I did was take <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/martinrue">@martinrue</a>&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/martinrue/Sentan">Sentan</a> project, fork it, made it run on mono (just because), ported it over to Ruby and renamed it <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/sentimentalizer/">sentimentalizer</a> (but keeping all necessary attribution to Martins work in the README of course).<!-- more -->  I did this for two reasons,</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted something fairly meaty to actually port over to Ruby in an effort to get a more-than-superficial feel for the language</li>
<li>I might have a need for such a service in an upcoming hackathon (though the original .NET version would have been fine too)</li>
</ol>


<p>This is in no way some sort of new project or intended for some production environment.</p>

<p>So what is it?  <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/sentimentalizer/">sentamentalizer</a> is a quick and dirty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a> tool.  With it you can loosley class statements as either positive or negative (and get a breakdown of how that classification was derived).  You &#8220;train&#8221; it with datasets for both negative and positive control statements and then feed it sentences you want analysed.  At the minute the engine sits behind a super super super, did I say super already?, simple sinatra app that you submit statements to and it returns a simple JSON response with the sentiment result (negative, positive, neutral) and probability.  If you want to train the bitch you&#8217;ve got to change the <code>api.rb</code> file or update the files in the <code>data\positive</code> and <code>data\negative</code> folders.</p>

<p>Plans? Yeah I might poke around some more, make into more of a standalone learning service or something (again another feature I might need soon anyway).  But for now - feel free to review my shitey code Rubyists (I assume there are better ways to do things, standard appraoches that I&#8217;m not using etc.) and offer suggestions.</p>

<p>Once again thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/martinrue">@martinrue</a> for doing all the hard-work on <a href="https://github.com/martinrue/Sentan">Sentan</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yay a technical post&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gigafied/minion">minion.js</a> is a micro framework providing classical inheritance strategy for JavaScript plus many other goodies.  It can be used in both browsers and <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>.<!-- more -->  Now I don&#8217;t want to get caught up in any of this classical inheritance for JavaScript is an anti-pattern stuff so just take this framework for what it is - a decent way to define both client and server side models for you JavaScripts!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already said it has a host of goodies that can be useful for creating a nice flexible set of models and associated helpers.  This includes,</p>

<ul>
<li>Class and inheritance support</li>
<li>Modularity</li>
<li>A cross model pub/sub mechanism</li>
<li>Statics, Singletons, static methods and properties</li>
<li>Dependency management</li>
<li>Some other stuff I&#8217;ve yet to touch upon&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>The code will more or less speak for itself here so lets dive in (the full suite of tests and sample node.js/express implementation can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kouphax/minion-tinkering">GitHub thingy</a>).</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>One of the first things I did was try out the whole inheritence thing.  I create a Fruit base class and provided a Strawberry implementation on top of it.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fruit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">Fruit</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;minion.Class&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">isInSeason</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">inSeason</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fruit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">Strawberry</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fruit.Fruit&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">inSeason</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using the Strawberry class is pretty damn simple.  First thing you need to do is a one off simple configuration of minion,</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">configure</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">classPath</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;js&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This just tells minions dependency manager where to start looking for your class implementations.  We can then start using the Strawberry class easily using minions <code>require</code> method</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">minion</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fruit.Strawberry&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Strawberry</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Strawberry</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">not</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">be</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Static Objects</h2>

<p>Static objects are pre-initialised Singletons in minion.js and that makes a lot of sense.  I created a Grocer static by simply extending another minion type <code>Static</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Pretty unsuprising but minion will new up a shared instance of this class the first time it is called.  You&#8217;ll see a little hint of the pub/sub mechanism in the <code>init</code> method as well so lets jump on that.</p>

<h2>Pub/Sub</h2>

<p>So minion has a nice little pub/sub mechanism built right into the classes as well.  So lets say a customer buys stuff from the grocer by publishing his/her request - sure beats just taking it without asking!!!</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Minion once again handles all the internal wiring up of this stuff and it just works.  Nice.</p>

<h2>The Rest</h2>

<p>There is more to minion.js, I&#8217;ve just given you a very high level view but you should dive a bit deeper by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/gigafied/minion/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md">official docs</a>.  There is a few bits of handy sugar sprinkled on the minion types (proxy, scoped setTimeout and setInterval).  The pub/sub also goes a bit further provinding <code>Notifications</code> that allow a sort of async callback/response mechanism which can be handy.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve never been a fan of these sorts of Class frameworks - I&#8217;ve never really seen the need but I must admit minion appeared at about the right time.  I&#8217;ve been playing with a nice way of structuring <a href="mongoosejs.com">mongoose</a> Schemas/Classes and I think minion here might be a nice fit.</p>

<p>Anyway check it out.  Yay a technical blog with more to come!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ya&#8217;ll about ready for another silly analogy?  I sure am&#8230;.</p>

<p>I work on the 6th floor and recently decided to start taking the stairs.  Mostly because I&#8217;ve let myself go and I really need to drop a few pounds and those stairs are a bit of a hard slog.  But it&#8217;s worth it.  <!-- more --> It&#8217;s funny how much of a better understanding of the building layout I get by just putting in the extra effort and going up the stairs.  The stairwell itself is pretty bland but I see extra doors, and I now know were many of doors could lead.</p>

<p>So the analogy&#8230; Taking the stairs is a bit like the whole software craftsmanship thing.  Sure I could just take the prescribed route, the default stack so to speak, and as with the stairs I&#8217;d probably get where I was going for a lot of the time.  But you know what?  I&#8217;d not know much more than the average person.  What if that lift was over capacity, out of order or just smelling of urine - I&#8217;d be able to manage just fine without getting stranded on a random floor wondering what to do next, if that door I never tried went were I wanted.  Imagine the stress involved if I was already late for a meeting.  Crickey!</p>

<p>So I put the extra effort in to understand things, and it&#8217;s already given me a better perspective on things.  It&#8217;s shown me other options, the ability to decide if the what I am doing is a good approach or perhaps there is a quicker, better, healthier route.</p>

<p>How does that grab you?</p>

<p>I really need to get off this analogy trip I&#8217;m on FFS!</p>

    <updated>2012-02-12T19:36:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/02/12/the-estimation-4x4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This post is dedicated to one of the most influential managers I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure to work with.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m of the opinion that the moment you start trying to apply complex mathematical rigour and time to estimation you&#8217;ve entered into a broken system. <!-- more --> You&#8217;re wasting time trying to protect yourself from finger pointing managers or getting a kicking from old school &#8220;us or them&#8221; lawyer types. None of that adds anything to the project except a big stick to beat people with and make sure they work themselves to death based a a random stab in the dark that is somehow made more realistic by the application if science. Ultimately though if the initial guesswork is wrong, and it&#8217;s seldom on the nose, the science means sweet FA. So why bother? You&#8217;re pleasing the wrong people. But then those people hold a lot of power.  So as long as we can keep them happy with the minimum of effort life should be sweet.</p>

<h2>The Answer</h2>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen I bring you the <strong>Estimation 4x4</strong> - guaranteed to knock those super science estimation techniques out of the park.</p>

<h2>The Science Bit</h2>

<p>Got a project to estimate?  I&#8217;ve done your homework for you - <strong>4 people, 4 weeks</strong>.  BOOM!  Mind Blown!  Now get on with delivering that project bro.  Oh wait it&#8217;s a big ass project - 4 people, 4 months.  Oh wait you&#8217;re limited by deadlines and/or resourcing - adjust as needed (3 people, 5 weeks or 5 people, 3 weeks).</p>

<h2>Balancing Act</h2>

<p>Careful now, 9 women dont make a baby in 1 month so don&#8217;t assume that scaling one side up to cater for the other will get the same results.  Theres a balance that needs addressed.  This is real science after all - repsect the rule and the rule will respect you.</p>

<h2>You Gotta Be Kidding Me</h2>

<p>Dont believe me?  Try it out next time.  Do your pseudo-scientific enterprise-ready finger in the air analysis.  But hey see when that project is finished see how close the 4x4 would have brought you to the real result.  I bet 9 times out of 10 it was as accurate as your real estimate, except you could have started much sooner&#8230;.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Caveat Abstractor]]></title>
    <link href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/02/09/caveat-abstractor/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-09T08:37:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/02/09/caveat-abstractor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Ramblings from 30,000ft.  The word abstraction is starting to sound odd.</em></p>

<p>Every time you create an abstraction there is a very good chance you&#8217;ve introduced unnecessary complexity into a solution.  It should never be done alone - it should be a team decision.  The goal of an abstraction is to simplify but in its untamed natural form an abstraction will only add complexity.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As programmers it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap whereby we want the code that we write to be the last time anyone ever has to write that code again.  We dream of creating reusable works of art that ever other developer will use and never be concerned with the low level implementation ever again.</p>

<p>This is wrong and impossible.  An anti-pattern even!</p>

<p>It baffles me that anyone would create an abstraction that they didn&#8217;t have a need for at the time. It&#8217;s wasteful and degrades the readability, grokability and all those other good &#8220;ilities&#8221; we use.  Of course I say this like i don&#8217;t do it myself but I&#8217;d be lying to you and myself.</p>

<p>An abstraction, by definition, is an intentional hiding of implementation and knowledge but surely understanding of these things will lead to a higher chance of success in a project?  The person that created the abstraction has that understanding but it&#8217;s like they dont want anyone else to know how it works.  They&#8217;re ready to take that secret to their grave.</p>

<p>When you start to abstract you need to remind yourself you are building a specific solution and not a framework (unless you are of course).  Abstractions should be done only within the scope of the project and you should have a strong case to back up its creation (make the decision a team effort).  This may sound like overhead but if you find it difficult to justify the creation odds are the abstraction is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Abstractions should not be grand, they should be light and convey their intent clearly by other people (pair programming and peer review will help weed out any verbose abstractions).</p>

<p>If you are creating an abstraction for anything other than DRY, odds are youre probably creating it for YAGNI.  You&#8217;ll start considering irrelevant use cases and having to cater for insane edge cases.  This will happen even if you are taking a strong test driven approach - you&#8217;ll concern youself with the workings of the abstraction rather then the problem you are solving and begin creating endless &#8220;what if&#8221; tests to cater for all those &#8220;0.00000001% chance of happening&#8221; edge cases. When this happens youre going to end up in mediocrity.  Mediocre abstractions attract more abstraction.  Even in a shared codebase bad abstractions create a certain amount of implied ownership to the person that created it. Inevitably someone will come along and create an abstraction around your abstraction (even if they have access to the original source).  This in turn will likely become YAMA (Yet Another Mediocre Abstraction) attracting yet more abstraction&#8230;. You can guess where I am going with that one&#8230; Its abstractions all the way down and everytime you abstract you&#8217;ve decreased system comphension and likely destroyed another future developers soul.</p>

<p>In the same way guns dont kill people, people do - Abstraction dont kill projects, developers do.  You&#8217;ve only got yourself to blame (been there done that, will be again).  A nice simple abstraction, at the right time (e.g. When needed) can be expressive and helpful but too often we put the abstraction before the need.</p>

<p>So consider abstractions as “guilty until proven innocent” not the other way around.  Solve YOUR problem - not every other problem, not until you need to.</p>

Enterprise is just that - one enterprise. Social is global, its all of us at anytime and that is so much bigger than some old enterprise. So if you try and pimp out your CV by using the term enterprise - the only people who are probably going to care are the managers and execs that think their little boring legacy system is unique and special&#8230; Do you really want to be sold that sort of job?  All bytes are equal, some are more equal than others - Pah!  Some are more mired in unnecessary abstraction, contracts and unread, out-of-date doucmentation but they are still bytes.</p>

    <id>http://yobriefca.se/blog/2012/01/05/using-parse-in-net-and-wp7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>UPDATE: Being completely wrong in assuming WP7 supports <code>dynamic</code> which apparently it doesn&#8217;t the current build wont run in WP7.  So another item on the list is a version that doesn&#8217;t rely on <code>dynamic</code> I guess.  Sorry for misleading anyone on that front - I did say it was rough and mostly untested right?</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse</a> is a site aimed at providing a simple service for pushing and pulling data on mobile devices.  You can create applications and store your mobile data there, create users, provide logon/off mechanisms and even achieve push notifications.  There are 2 ways to access <a href="https://www.parse.com/">Parse</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li>Via its natively compiled binaries (on iOS and Android)</li>
<li>Via a its Rest API (for all non iOS/Android devices and desktops)</li>
</ol>


<p>Now I wanted to try and create bindings for the iOS library so I could use it for a Monotouch application I&#8217;ve been playing with but truth be told the whole process confused the hell out of me.  Thing was the REST API gave me everything I needed so I started recently to write a dynamic wrapper around the API.  Currently built on .NET in Visual Studio (Mono on my list) with a few sanity tests it works well enough to put it out there incase anyone was wanting to do something similar and could extract value from it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty early at the minute - in fact all you can do with this first spike is basic object CRUD.  No querying yet, no special user management features etc.  But they will come.  So what could you use it for?  Well a number of things,</p>

<ul>
<li>WP7 Cloud Storage</li>
<li>Monotouch (and Monodroid) storage until someone smarter than me creates proper bindings to the actual iOS frameworks</li>
<li>It&#8217;s an object store so why not use it to store data on any web app?</li>
<li>Just for tinkering.</li>
</ul>


<p>It makes use of <code>dynamic</code> from .NET 4 so you can kind of pass it arbitrary stuff and get arbitrary stuff back (Parse is schemaless so this makes sense for me).  It also means you wont have to create concrete classes for every single thing you want to store.</p>

<p>If you want to run the tests you&#8217;ll need to sign up for Parse, create an app and update the <code>consts</code> in <code>describe_Parsely</code> to point to your new app (and authenticate).</p>

<h2>Outstanding Tasks</h2>

<p>Lots.  But here is the main ones I see right now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile on Mono and show MonoTouch some Parse love.</li>
<li>Samples (for WP7, Monotouch, possibly Monodroid)</li>
<li>Add Queries</li>
<li>Add User Management</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s probably fairly rough right now and could do with some TLC if anyone wants to pitch in?  I&#8217;ve given it a name (Parsley) but that in no way implies this is going to be a long running project or anything.  I just like naming things.  Get it while it&#8217;s hot, the code is in my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kouphax/parsley">usual place</a>.</p>

<h2>Pre-Post Update</h2>

<p>Rather than update this blog post I decided to tack this on here.  With BitBucket experiencing some issues at present I spent about 10 minutes hacking in the user management features.  No tests written yet (oh no I have broken all the rules and must be beaten with oversized crayons) so lets just say that it&#8217;s very edge, very experimental at the minute.  Also bonus - returning a collection of objects is implemented as <code>Query</code> but again totally untested (fast and loose - it&#8217;s how I roll son).  There be dragons there therebe!</p>

<p>Happy hacking.</p>

<p>Can I have my WP7 MVP now please?  <strong>Kidding</strong></p>

<p>What the base class does is create the necessary CRUDdy urls with a base route starting with the name of the entity you pass in, pluralised in the easiest way possible.  In this case <code>/questions</code>.  The rules match what you wold get for a controller in Rails.</p>

<p>There is a teeny-tiny bit of sugar in the <code>AsView</code> method that will look up the corresponding view.  So the module above would resolve its <code>Index</code> method to <code>questions/index</code> and the view engine would find the correct file (eg. for Razor - <code>questions/index.cshtml</code>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already said it&#8217;s a bit of fun but I have actually used this at least once - there is probably more that could be added but it&#8217;ll do for a first spike at least.  Any use to anyone?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure where this post is going to go in terms of content.  I&#8217;m thinking a bit of full disclosure might be quite cathartic but at the same time do you really want to know the ins and out of my somewhat awful 2011?  Compromise - I&#8217;ll keep it short.  Possibly.</p>

<h2>2011 (The Bad Parts)</h2>

<p>2011 was a pretty terrible year if I&#8217;m honest.  It was the year my wife suffered two miscarriages, I got into my first car accident, stuff kept breaking and I totally dropped the ball in work when I burnt out (I&#8217;m certain I&#8217;m still feeling the effects of that).  Oh and yes on top of all that I was diagnosed with severe depression for which I am now fully medicated.  But you know what?  I&#8217;m not alone - I know a ton of people for whom (look at me I said whom - how posh) 2011 was grim.</p>

<p>So lets cast aside all the personal stuff, we&#8217;ve all had our problems, and let me talk about the burn out.  Long and short of it was that I took too much work on and eventually delivered unacceptable results for them all.  I have something akin to ADD when it comes to work and unless I am suitably challenged or stimulated my productivity drops to pretty much nil.  2011 was full of time consuming mundane boring work for me and as I tried desperately to pull personal value from the work (or hobbies) I started making mistakes, over committing and generally under achieving.  Lesson learned - I need to learn to say no and sometimes I just need to suck up the fact that we can&#8217;t all be doing the best part of our jobs ALL THE TIME.  Sometimes we need to just knuckle down and get on with it.  Just not for a full year&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway I became somewhat disillusioned with my employer and, truthfully, Northern Ireland.  I like other people to be excited about the stuff I preach but I felt there was a lot of disinterest and empty words.  This annoyed me and I guess I just started pushing harder, which I guess made me look quite angry and pushy.  This obviously wouldn&#8217;t help.  When I looked outside of my company - Northern Ireland didn&#8217;t seem that much better.  So I felt a bit out of place and I had 2 choices ahead of me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Up sticks and go somewhere that I felt would be more receptive to my extreme nerdyness and desire to share it.</li>
<li>Stick around, my company and Northern Ireland and try and make a difference.</li>
</ol>


<p>I chose the second, not being to be hero or anything but for more pragmatic reasons,</p>

<ul>
<li>My wife got pregnant again (due soon yay!), the economy is terrible and it would be too much of a risk right now</li>
<li><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='It is better to invest in people and risk them leaving than to not invest in them and risk them staying '>
If I stayed in Northern Ireland, or even Ireland, I don&#8217;t believe there is any other company that would support me (aka let me get away with) the things I do.  I&#8217;m not the most predictable of sorts.  I work weird hours and do strange things.  <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> have always been there for me and supported me.  Having done interviews with people from various levels from various other companies the state of other IT firms makes me seethe with anger. It is better to invest in people and risk them leaving than to not invest in them and risk them staying&#8221;
</span></li>
</ul>


<p>So I start 2012 with a big challenge set for myself.  That sounds about right.  The more I think about <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a>, my employer, deserves more credit than I give it.  We have been in a space thats been all about big business types with big enterprisey solutions and delivered well.  It&#8217;s not an area that exactly screams enthusiasm and I think it will take a while to draw people out of that kind of insular thinking. <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> certainly seems to be better than most in this area.  Now enough gushing about <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> (who are hiring BTW)</p>

<h2>2011 (The Good Parts)</h2>

<p>OK OK 2011 wasn&#8217;t all sob stories and dullness some really cool things happened.</p>

<ul>
<li>My CodeSlice initiative in work (meet at least once a month, talk nerdy things, get <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> to pay for free pizza) didn&#8217;t die.  In fact in the hands of one of my colleagues, Jonny Holmes, it flourished.  Attendence was never HUGE but it was consistent and varied.  May long this tradition continue and hopefully we can expand it..</li>
<li>I organised and participated in not one but two hackathons (internally).  Once again <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> covered the costs for our weekend long hack sessions.  Turnout was decent (about 8-12 people) with all types turning up - managers, placement students, technical architects etc.  The experience was enough for me - which is a clever way of saying the end products weren&#8217;t as good as envisaged.  But we drew so many valuable lessons that the second one was infinitely more successful that the first - live and learn!  And, oh lord, the plans I have for the first half of 2012 around hackathons are going to be legendary!</li>
<li>I talked, and not just to myself but to real people, real people who were not paid to be there!  I talked, outside of work, a total of three times.  I know the number isn&#8217;t huge but it was late on in the year before I decided to get out there.  Already topped that number for 2012 and the year hasn&#8217;t started.  Double figures would be good next year thank you.</li>
<li>I attended <a href="http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2011/">GOTO Amsterdam</a> were I got to meet a lot of people I have deemed awesome (because they are).  Being in rooms with like minded people (who are generally much smarter than me) saying things that make you realise you are not insane for thinking things could be better really strengthens your beliefs!</li>
<li>Shared more.  All the stuff above I did because I wanted to get my thoughts out there - I wanted to be educated as well as educate.  I was happy to look like a fool if it meant I didn&#8217;t look like a fool later.  Thats hard for an introvert but damn it I gave it my best shot.  I know people, the one who only know me through my writing on <a href="http://yammer.com">Yammer</a> or half-read blog post, think I am a purist (I&#8217;m not - perfect is the enemy of better), or angry (not me, frustrated at times but never angry), or opinionated (openly opinionated perhaps) or even annoyed that everyone isn&#8217;t dancing the happy geek dance like myself (as long as I&#8217;m not dancing alone on the dance floor like a sleazy old man stalking girls half his age I&#8217;m happy).  Thats fine.  People reckon I risk detracting from the message I am trying to communicate.  Fair enough.  Perhaps I need to tone it down sometimes - but I can&#8217;t see that happening - it&#8217;s no in my nature.  I think it&#8217;s better that people see me as a purist and take some of my ideas away rather than being half-assed and them not taking anything on board!  It&#8217;s inevitable that when I try and challenge peoples conceptions of technical things, especially in the open, it&#8217;s going to leave a sour taste in some peoples mouths.  But thats how I roll and thats how it should be.  Sorry but there is more on the way.  But I take as good as I give so come at me bros!</li>
<li>Won a years to subscription to <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> on Christmas Day thanks Rob &#8216;Santa Clause&#8217; Conrey.</li>
<li>Put my foot in it a few times.  Yeah sounds odd I am classing this as a good thing but Scott Hanselman gave me permission, and I <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BestPracticesForIndividualContribution.aspx">quote</a></li>

<blockquote><p>Chris Sells told me once, If you’re not getting in trouble with your boss at least twice a year, you’re likely not pushing the envelope hard enough. Two slaps a year might be the cost for 10 successes. If you’re not moving forward, well, you’re not moving forward.</p></blockquote>

<h2>2012 (More like 20AWESOME! AMIRITE!)</h2>

<p>So enough dwelling in the past - how am I going to make 2012 be the awesomest?  Well thats easy - <strong>set some real fecking goals</strong>.  I failed to do that last year (outside of my typical career goals during my annual reviews of course) and ended up coasting in parts.  Not next year - hells no.  I got me a bucket list (stuff to do before the year dies - not me - unless that comes first - oh god I never thought of that).  TO THE LIST!</p>

<h3>2012 Bucket List (In No Particular Order)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Release a screencast</li>
<li>Release a game</li>
<li>Appalachian Trail</li>
<li><a href="http://givecampni.org.uk">GiveCamp NI</a></li>
<li>Talk/Present as often as possible</li>
<li>Learn a new language</li>
<li>Contribute more to OSS</li>
</ul>


<p>So let me explain some of these, as I am sure they mean sweet FA to some of you.</p>

<h3>Release a Screencast</h3>

<p>A lot of my blog posts last year were a kind of &#8220;Introduction to Technology X&#8221; and I think that sort of knowledge can be better shared via video and real coding.  Coupled with my desire to go a bit deeper in my technical posts but always getting distracted with other blog posts I think 2012 is the year I try my hand at producing a real life proper screencast (or perhaps a series).  With decent production values and what not.  The topic?  Well I am currently thinking <a href="http://nancyfx.org">Nancy</a> but I need to really get my head around it a lot than I already do - but thats fine.  Time will tell on that one.</p>

<h3>Release a Game</h3>

<p>Game programming is an area I&#8217;ve failed to venture into and I feel it is about time.  I wan&#8217;t to do something really simple, something mobiley possibly using <a href="http://impactjs.com/">ImpactJS</a> because it interests me.  I&#8217;d like to release said game into an app store as well - just to watch it get flamed and to say &#8220;I&#8217;ve done it&#8221;</p>

<h3>Appalachian Trail</h3>

<p>This is a codename for a current unfunded project of mine.  The goal is to get a more fuller understanding of the spectrum of mobile development approaches, platforms and technologies.  So simply put generate a bunch of super simple (though still useful) app ideas and using every conceivable type of technology from native to web and all in-between deliver decent quality apps across all the major platforms through hackathons, team challenges, school and university outreach, app camps etc..</p>

<p>Sounds awesome doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h3>GiveCamp NI</h3>

<blockquote><p>GiveCamp was founded by Microsoft Developer Evangelist, Chris Koenig, in Dallas, Texas in 2007. His vision was to bring together passionate developers and local charitable organisations for an entire weekend, and see what would happen.</p>

<p>In late 2012 GiveCamp is coming to Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thats what the <a href="http://givecampni.org.uk/">official site</a> says (I should know I put it there).  So late next year we will run GiveCamp for the first time in Northern Ireland.  A weekend long charity focused public hackathon.  It&#8217;s going to be a belter!</p>

<h3>Talk/Present as often as possible</h3>

<p>I enjoy talking about nerdy things.  I got a taste for it last year when I went public (having been talking internally to <a href="http://www.kainos.com">Kainos</a> staff for years) and in 2012 I really want to get out there as much as possible.  I find it an amazing way for me to learn as well as understand whats going on in the industry.  So far I am speaking in <a href="http://dublinalt.net/2011/12/14/january-meetup-calling-all-mobile-devs/">Dublin in January</a>, <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">Devweek in London</a> and a few other un-announced venues.</p>

<p>BTW if anyone can recommend conferences I should pitch for, or want me to come over and talk about anything in the .NET/JavaScript/Mobie world(s) (see my blog for the kind of thing I know about) - let me know!</p>

<h3>Learn a new language</h3>

<p>Everyone says this one right?  Yeah so I spent last year looking at node.js and Ruby and I think it&#8217;s time to get out of my safe - I&#8217;m thinking F# - yeah that sounds sweet!</p>

<h3>Contribute more to OSS</h3>

<p>I head-dived into OSS .NET last year and loved it.  Many people see .NET as a very restricted, Microsoft led platform were every modern web-app is MVC3 with Entity Framework and WCF rules the web service world.  Thats total bull.  .NET has a very vibrant, very active OSS community.  There is almost no need to use any MS technology ever.  But lets not forget MS have really started to embrace and support OSS in a big way.  Lets hope that trend continues!</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Boooo to 2011, Yay to 2012.  See you around the same time next year when I have another failful year and promising myself a better one in 2013 :-P</p>
